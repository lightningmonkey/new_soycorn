Safrinha Corn Estimate in Parana Continues to Increase
<p>
	In the second major safrinha corn producing state in Brazil, Parana, the yields and the production of the second crop of corn continues to increase.  In their latest assessment of the crop, the state Secretary of Agriculture is estimating the safrinha corn crop will set a new record yield of 5,388 kg/ha (83 bu/ac), which if verified, it would represent a 13% increase over last year.  The secretary estimates that the state will produce 10.2 million tons of corn which is 3% more than their last estimate.

	The corn harvest in the state was 60% complete as of last week with the highest yields (5,769 kg/ha or 89 bu/ac) being reported in the western part of the state where 85% of the corn has been harvested.  The yields are not quite as good in the northern part of the state (5,307 kg/ha or 81.7 bu/ac), but they still represent an increase of 26% compared to last growing season.  Approximately 35% of the corn in northern Parana has been harvested and the corn that remains in the field is rated 92% good and 8% average.

	Farmers in Parana continue to switch their corn production from full-season corn to safrinha corn production which is planted after the first crop of soybeans are harvested.  During the 2013/14 growing season farmers in the state planted 671,000 hectares of full-season corn and 1,901,000 hectares of safrinha corn which was down 12% from the 2,169,000 hectares planted in 2012/13.

	Due to low corn prices and relatively strong wheat prices earlier in 2014, some farmers in the state decided to plant more winter wheat in lieu of safrinha corn.

As far as the 2014/15 growing season is concerned, producers in the state are expected to once again switch some of their full-season corn acreage to safrinha corn production.  In addition to a relatively stronger price for soybeans, planting the first crop to soybeans allows farmers to plant a second crop of either corn or wheat.  If the first crop is full-season corn, then there is only enough time for a second crop of winter wheat.
