<h3><h3>Brazil may Plant up to 1.0 Million Hectares of Safrinha Soybeans</h3></h3>
<p>
	One of the big unknowns in Brazil this growing season is what Brazilian farmers will plant as a second crop after the soybeans are harvested.  Farmers are still weighing their options and as a result, very few inputs have been purchased for the second crop which will be planted early next year.  Their dilemma revolves around the fact that domestic corn prices in Brazil and especially in Mato Grosso are currently below the cost of production and there are not many signs that corn prices will improve any time soon. 
</p>
<p>
	As a result, there is speculation that farmers in Brazil may plant as much as one million hectares of <i>safrinha</i> soybeans replacing some of the anticipated <i>safrinha</i> corn acreage.  Soybeans are a better option economically if you just look at the price, but planting two crops of soybeans back-to-back comes with a higher risk for increased disease and insect pressure.
</p>
<p>
	Agronomist and entomologist are advising farmers not to plant a second crop of soybeans due to the new threat from corn earworm as well as their old nemesis soybean rust.  No one knows for sure how expensive it will be to control the corn earworm or if they will be successful in their control measures, but one thing is certain, the multiple sprays needed to control the insect is going to increase the cost of production.  Soybean rust is another factor, but we won't get an indication of how bad rust will be until later in the growing season. 
</p>
<p>
	Brazilian farmers must take into consideration the fact that if they plant a second crop of soybeans, those soybeans must be harvested before June 15, 2014 when the 90-day soybean free period starts.  If they do not harvest their soybeans by that date, they would be subject to a hefty fine.  Therefore, if they intend to plant a 100 day maturity soybean variety, it should be planted no later than about March 1st.    
</p>
<p>
	For two years in a row, farmers in Mato Grosso have heavily invested in increased <i>safrinha</i> corn production and it has paid off handsomely until this year.  During the 2012/13 growing season, Mato Grosso produced 22 million tons of corn, which is up from just 7 million tons during the 2010/11 growing season.
</p>
<p>
	The record large harvest has resulted in a huge amount of excess corn in the state which only consumes a little more than 3 million tons domestically.  The remainder of the corn must be transported out of the state at very high costs to exporters or livestock producers in southern Brazil.  Many farmers are still holding onto their corn while they wait for higher prices or the government to purchase their corn.
</p>
<p>
	The current thinking is that farmers will reduce their <i>safrinha</i> corn acreage and plant more soybeans, cotton, dry beans, sunflowers, grain sorghum, millet, canola, etc.  How much they will reduce their <i>safrinha</i> corn acreage is still speculative, but Imea (the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics) has already estimated that the <i>safrinha</i> corn acreage will decline 9% and the yields will decline 20% resulting in a reduction of 27% in <i>safrinha</i> corn production. 
</p>
<p>
Without a doubt, the <i>safrinha</i> corn acreage in Brazil will decline in 2013/14 and there will also be two types of <i>safrinha</i> corn production in 2014.  Some farmers may opt for maximized yields and they will use high levels of technology in the hope that high yields will compensate for the higher costs.  Other farmers will take the opposite approach and use lower levels of technology and hope that the weather cooperates so they can at least break even on their <i>safrinha</i> corn production.
