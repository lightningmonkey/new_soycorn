<h3><h3>Dryer Weather Allows for Some Planting Progress in Argentina</h3></h3>
<p>
	<b>Argentina corn</b> - Farmers in Argentina had a small window of dryer weather last week that allowed for some planting progress.  The corn crop in Argentina is approximately 45% planted, which is an increase of only about 5% compared to last week and the planting pace is still 14% behind that of last year.  In the heart of the production area, the corn crop is approximately 60% to 90% planted, while is southern Argentina it is 40% to 60% planted and in northern Argentina it is 5% to 20% planted.

	Even though it looks like the near term weather forecast is favorable, planting progress will probably remain slow for several more weeks because farmers do not like to plant corn during the month of November because that would result in pollination occurring during the hottest time of the year.  If the weather permits, the planting of the corn crop will be completed in early December.

As an illustration of just how wide the planting window is in Argentina, there are some corn fields in Argentina that have already pollinating and yet less than half of the entire corn crop has been planted.

	<b>Argentina soybeans</b> - Argentine farmers have planted approximately 11% of their intended soybean acreage.  Some farmers have decided to start planting their soybeans even though not all the corn has been planted.  They may actually finish planting soybeans before they go back and complete corn planting.  Soybean planting progress would had been faster had it not been for saturated conditions across the heart of the production belt in Buenos Aires as well as southern Cordoba and southern Santa Fe.  In the heart of the production area approximately 15% to 25% of the soybeans have been planted.  In southern locations, its less than 10% has been planted and in northern locations, it is 0% to 10% planted.
