<h3><h3>New Wheat Variety Could Double Wheat Yields in Brazil</h3></h3>
<p>
	A new variety of wheat for Brazilian producers is being previewed at the 2014 Agrishow currently underway in Ribeiao Preto, Sao Paulo.  The new variety named IAC 385 Mojave has the potential to double wheat yields in southern Brazil from the state of Sao Paulo southward to the state of Rio Grande do Sul.  The variety was developed by the Agronomic Institute of Campinas in Sao Paulo.

Conventional wheat varieties currently grown in the state of Sao Paulo have a typical yield of 3,000 kg/ha (approximately 44 bu/ac).  The new IAC 385 Mojave wheat variety has a yield potential of 6,000 kg/ha (approximately 87 bu/ac).

	In addition to much higher yields, the new variety also can save up to 30% on reduced fungicide applications.  Generally, farmers in southern Brazil apply two or three applications of fungicides to control foliar fungal diseases.  Due to improved diseases resistance, this new variety would require only one or at the most two fungicide applications.

The new wheat variety also produces high quality flower which millers in Brazil demand for specialty breads.  Millers also like this new variety because of the color of the flower.  The color of wheat flower is judged on a scale from zero (black) to 100 (white).  This variety has a rating of 94 and a rating of 92 to 94 is judged white in color.  Flower with a rating of less than 92 are judged to have a yellowish color.  There are currently no wheat varieties in the Brazilian market with a rating above 94.
