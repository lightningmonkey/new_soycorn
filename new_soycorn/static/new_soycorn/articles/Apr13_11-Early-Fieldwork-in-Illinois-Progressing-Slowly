<h3><h3>Early fieldwork in Illinois Progressing Slowly</h3></h3>
<p>
	 We traveled from the southern tip of Illinois to Chicago on Saturday, April 9, 2011 and through the entire length of the state, we did not see any tractors in the field working ground or planting corn.  The wettest area of the state appeared to be central and south-central Illinois where many fields had standing water left over from earlier rains.  Additional rains moved through the state on Sunday evening and Monday keeping the soils too wet for field work at least for a few more days.

	We saw very few fields of corn that had been planted in Illinois and only a couple fields where the corn had started to germinate.  The few fields that had been planted were generally between Champaign and Effingham in the south-central part of the state.

	It's still early of course and there is plenty of time for Illinois farmers to plant their corn in a timely manner, but corn planting in the state is getting off to somewhat of a slower start than it did last year, at least in the areas that we traveled.
