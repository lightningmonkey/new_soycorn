Harvesting of Extra Early Soybeans Started in Mato Grosso
<p>
	Soybean farmers in Mato Grosso who were lucky enough to get their early maturing soybeans planted in a timely fashion have now started to harvest some of their 2010/11 soybean 
crop.  Early harvest activity is being reported in Sapezal and Campos de Julio in western Mato Grosso and in Sorriso, Lucas do Rio Verde, Nova Mutum, and Sinop in central Mato Grosso as well as Campo Verde in southeastern Mato Grosso.  Statewide, it's estimated that 0.3% of the soybeans have been harvested compared to 1.5% last year at this time.

Early yield reports from western Mato Grosso are in the range of 48 sacks per hectare (2,880 kg/ha or 41.7 bu/ac).  It's not the best yield ever, but it is certainly acceptable.  The pace of harvesting in Mato Grosso will accelerate between January 15 to the 20th and it will remain intense through February.  The harvest in Mato Grosso will end sometime in March.

	Extra early maturing soybeans represent approximately 1% to 2% of all the soybeans planted in Mato Grosso.  Early maturing soybeans are planted on approximately 10% of the area and semi-early soybeans represent 70% of the total acreage.  Normal maturing soybeans now represent only 19% of the soybean acreage in Mato Grosso.  The continued shift to earlier maturing soybeans reflects the desire of Mato Grosso farmers to plant two crops in their fields during a single growing season.

	If soybeans are harvested during January, there will still be enough time to plant a second crop of cotton.  The planting window for <i>safrinha</i> cotton in Mato Grosso generally closes about the end of January.  The planting window for <i>safrinha</i> corn in Mato Grosso extends until the end of February.
