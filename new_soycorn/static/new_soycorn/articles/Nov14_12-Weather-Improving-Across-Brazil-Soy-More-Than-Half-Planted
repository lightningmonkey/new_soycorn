Weather Improving Across Brazil, Soy More Than Half Planted 
<p>
	The weather pattern in central Brazil has definitely turned wetter this past week.  Most of the previously dry areas of central Brazil and northeastern Brazil received rain over the past week and more is in the forecast.  This is allowing farmers in the dryer areas of eastern Mato Grosso, Goias, Tocantins, and Bahia to start planting their 2012/13 soybean crop.  It is also allowing for farmers to replant the soybeans that had poor germination.  In southern Brazil the weather has turned dryer, which is also helping the farmers to get their soybeans planted.

<p>
	Approximately 55%-58% of the 2012/13 Brazilian soybean crop has been planted, which is about 13% more than last week, but it is still 10% to 12% behind last year's planting pace.  In Mato Grosso approximately 80% of the soybeans have been planted compared to 87% last year.  Parana farmers have planted approximately 74% of their soybeans, which is equal to last year.
