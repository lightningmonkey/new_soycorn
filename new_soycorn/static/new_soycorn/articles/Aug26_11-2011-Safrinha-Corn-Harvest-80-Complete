<h3><h3>2011 Safrinha Corn Harvest 80% Complete</h3></h3>
<p>
	The harvest of the <i>safrinha</i> corn crop in Brazil is approaching 80% complete, which is just slightly slower than the 85% harvested last year at this time.  In the center-west states of Mato Grosso and Goias the harvest is complete and in Mato Grosso do Sul it is 75% complete.  Late planting and the early onset of the dry season negatively impacted the corn crop in Mato Grosso, which is the largest producer of <i>safrinha</i> corn in Brazil.
</p>
<p>
	The Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) estimate that the <i>safrinha</i> corn yields in Mato Grosso fell to 3,900 kg/ha (60 bu/ac) and that the latest planted corn was the most adversely affected.  The yields of some of the latest corn harvested in Mato Grosso fell to 3,000 kg/ha or just 46 bu/ac.

	The remaining areas of <i>safrinha</i> corn to be harvested are the states of Parana (62% harvested) and Sao Paulo (58% harvested).  A significant portion of the <i>safrinha</i> corn in Parana is expected to be of very poor quality due to a series of freezing temperatures that hit the crop while it was still early in its grain filling process.
</p>
<p>
	Strong domestic corn prices are very attractive for farmers in Brazil who have already indicated that they intend to increase their <i>safrinha</i> corn acreage in 2012.  Imea is estimating that farmers in Mato Grosso will plant 2 million hectares of <i>safrinha</i> corn in 2012, which would be a 14% increase over the 1.7 million hectares planted in 2011.
