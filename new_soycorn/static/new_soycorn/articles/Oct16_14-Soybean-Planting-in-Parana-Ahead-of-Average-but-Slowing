Soybean Planting in Parana Ahead of Average but Slowing
<p>
	The soybean planting in Parana is the most advanced of the major soybean producing states in Brazil.  According to the Secretary of Agriculture for the state of Parana, 33% of the soybeans in the state have been planted, which represents an advance of 13% in a week and it is ahead of the five year average of 22%.

	The most advanced planting pace is in the western part of the state near the cities of Cascavel and Toledo where the planting is nearing completion.  The slowest planting pace is in the southern part of the state where less than 5% of the soybeans have been planted due to wet conditions.

	In the northern part of the state, soybean planting started out good, but now dry weather and high temperatures has convinced the farmers to park their planters while they wait for additional rainfall.  In the city of Maringa in northern Parana the temperatures thus far during October have been running 6 degrees C above the long term average (+11 degrees F).  In neighboring city of Londrina, they have been running 4 degrees C above average (+8 degrees F).

	Delayed soybean planting in the northern part of the state could eventually impact the planting of the safrinha corn crop.  The majority of the second crop of corn in the state is grown in the northern part of the state.  In the more southern locations, the second crop planted after soybeans is generally winter wheat.

	The forecast is calling for rainfall to move into the state later this week and over the weekend and if that does turn out to be the case, there will be enough time to get the crop planted in a timely manner.
