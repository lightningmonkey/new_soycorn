Safrinha Corn Crop in Parana should Surpass Full-Season Crop     
<p>
	Farmers in Parana are probably going to opt to plant more <i>safrinha</i> corn and less wheat and dry beans after they harvest their early maturing soybeans.   That is the opinion of Deral (the Department of Rural Economics) in their latest assessment of the crops in Parana.  In fact, the <i>safrinha</i> corn production in the state should surpass the full-season corn production.
</p>
<p>
Deral is estimating that the <i>safrinha</i> corn crop in Parana will be 9.32 million tons, which if achieved, would be an increase of 48% compared to last year'CinFs crop which was severely impacted by freezing temperatures.  Total <i>safrinha</i> corn acreage in the state is expected to up by 10% compared to the last crop to 1.86 million hectares.  If achieved, this would set a new record for <i>safrinha</i> production and surpass the prior record of 6.5 million tons set in 2009/10.  
</p>
<p>
If the weather cooperates, the <i>safrinha</i> corn should be planted on time in January and February and potential corn yields should be higher than last year due to the increased use of GMO corn hybrids.  For the full-season corn crop, they are estimating a production of 7.4 million tons, which is the same as in their November estimate and 20% more than the 6.1 million tons produced in 2010/11.

With favorable growing conditions in the state, Deral only made minor adjustments in their December soybean estimate.  They are currently estimating the Parana soybean crop at 14.12 million tons vs. 14.16 million in their November estimate.  Soybean yields in 2011/12 are not expected to match those of last year when the state produced a record soybean crop of 15.3 million tons.

<p>
The wheat harvest is complete in the state and the wheat crop is estimated at 2.4 million tons, which is unchanged from November, but one million tons more than what was produced in 2010/11.
