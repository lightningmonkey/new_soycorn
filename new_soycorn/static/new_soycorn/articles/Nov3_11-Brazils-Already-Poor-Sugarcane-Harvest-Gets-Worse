<h3><h3>Brazil's Already Poor Sugarcane Harvest Gets Worse</h3></h3>
<p>
	In their latest report, the Union of Sugarcane Industries (UNICA) has once again lowered their estimate for the amount of sugarcane that will be produced in southern Brazil during the 2011/12 harvest season.  UNICA makes these estimates in association with the Center for Sugarcane Technology (CTC) and various organizations within the sugar/ethanol sector.
</p>
<p>
	In their new estimate, UNICA estimates that 488.5 million tons of sugarcane will be processed in southern Brazil during the 2011/12 harvest season, which is 4.2% less than their August estimate (510 million tons) and 12.2% less than what was processed last year (556 million tons).
</p>
<p>
	The Center for Sugarcane Technology estimates that through the end of September the average sugarcane yield in southern Brazil has been 70.6 tons per hectare, which is 18.2% less than during the same period last year.  By the time the harvest is ended later this month, the final sugarcane yield is expected to be slightly less than 70 tons per hectare, which is 20% less than the historical average of 85 tons per hectare.
</p>
<p>
	In addition to the lower yields, the quality of the sugarcane being harvested this year is also of inferior quality compared to last year. UNICA estimates that the Total Recoverable Sugars will average 137.3 kilograms per ton, which would be 2.7% less than previously estimated.
</p>
<p>
	UNICA estimates that 51.8% of the sugarcane will be used to produce ethanol and 48.2% will be used to produce sugar.  Total sugar production in southern Brazil in 2011/12 is now estimated at 30.8 million tons, which is 2.4% less than the last estimate and 8% less than last year (33.5 million tons).  Total ethanol production is now estimated at 20.3 billion liters, which is 2.9% less than last estimate and 19.6% less than last year.  Approximately 61.5% of the ethanol will be sold as E100 and 38.5% will be blended into gasoline.
</p>
<p>
Sugar exports from southern Brazil in 2011/12 are now estimated at 21.2 million tons or 14% less than last year.  Total ethanol exports from southern Brazil are expected to be 1.6 billion liters or down 6.6% compared to last year.  The ethanol exports out of southern Brazil are being used to fulfill previous contracts.  
</p>
<p>
	The mixture of ethanol in gasoline was lowered in October in order to extend the reduced ethanol supplies, but even with this reduction, Brazil is importing ethanol in order to meet domestic demand.  From April thought the end of September Brazil imported 567 million liters of ethanol and by the time the next sugarcane harvest starts in March of next year, it is estimated that Brazil's total ethanol imports will hit 1.2 billion liters.
</p>
<p>
	The state of Sao Paulo is the largest sugarcane producing state in Brazil, but 2011/12 has been a huge disappointment.  It is estimated that the productivity of sugarcane per hectare will be lowest in 20 years especially in the regions of Ribeirao Preto, Sao Jose do Rio Preto, and Aracatuba.
