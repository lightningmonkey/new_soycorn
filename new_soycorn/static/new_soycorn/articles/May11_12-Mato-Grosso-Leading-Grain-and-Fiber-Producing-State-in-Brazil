Mato Grosso Leading Grain and Fiber Producing State in Brazil
<p>
	The state of Mato Grosso continues to solidify its position as the number one grain and fiber producing state in Brazil with an estimated 36 million tons of production in 2011/12.  In its May report, Conab estimated that the total production in the state would increase 18.4% compared to 2010/11.  The second leading grain producing state is Parana, but their production declined 10.4% to 29 million tons due to the severe drought that impacted the crops in southern Brazil.
