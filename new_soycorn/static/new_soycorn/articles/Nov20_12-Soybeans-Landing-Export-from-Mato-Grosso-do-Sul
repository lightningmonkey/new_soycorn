Soybeans Leading Export from Mato Grosso do Sul
<p>
	Soybeans continue to be the leading agricultural export product from the state of Mato Grosso do Sul followed by sugar, beef, and cellulose.  Combined, these four agricultural products represent 55% (US$ 1.95 billion) of the state's total value of exports during the first ten months of 2012.

The value of the soybean exports from the state during the first ten months of 2012 totaled US$ 705 million.  The total volume of soybean exports was 1.37 million tons or 30% of the state's soybean production in 2011/12, which was 4.62 million tons.

While the state is not a major sugar producing state in Brazil, sugar production is increasing.  Sugar export sales during the period reached US$ 524 million on exports of 1.0 million tons, which represented 50% of the estimated 1.92 million tons of sugar produced thus far in 2012.

The state contains the second largest cattle herd in Brazil after Mato Grosso so it is not surprising that beef is a major export product from the state.  Of the four principal agricultural products exported from the state, the value of boned and chilled beef exports (US$ 245 million) registered the greatest percentage increase compared to last year -o 51%.  The volume of beef exports increased 62% from 51,500 tons during the first ten months of 2011 to 83, 500 tons in 2012.

The volume of cellulose exports from the state declined slightly year-on-year from 766,800 tons in 2011 to 765,800 tons in 2012.  The cellulose is from eucalyptus plantations used for pulp production.

The total exports from the state during the first ten months of 2012 totaled US$ 3.5 billion or 5.3% more than the same period in 2011.
