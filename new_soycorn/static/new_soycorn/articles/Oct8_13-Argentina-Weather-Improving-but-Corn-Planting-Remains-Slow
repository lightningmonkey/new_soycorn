<h3><h3>Argentina Weather Improving but Corn Planting Remains Slow</h3></h3>
<p>
	Some rain fell across central Argentina last week, but many areas still remain dry including parts of Cordoba, southern Santa Fe, and western Buenos Aires.  Springtime temperatures were cool across much of Argentina last week but the forecast is calling for warmer temperatures this week.

<p>
	Corn planting picked up last week in areas where they did receive rainfall with approximately 10% of the 2013/14 corn crop now planted, but that is still about half the normal planting pace.  The most advanced corn planting is in the province of Entry Rios in eastern Argentina where as much as half of the corn has been planted.

	There may be a few fields of soybeans planted in Argentina and the planting pace will now start to pick up since we are into October and the temperatures are expected to warm up.
