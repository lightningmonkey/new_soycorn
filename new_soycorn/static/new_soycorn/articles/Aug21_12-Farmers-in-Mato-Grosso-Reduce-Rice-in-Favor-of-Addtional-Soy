<h3><h3>Farmers in Mato Grosso Reduce Rice in Favor of Additional Soy</h3></h3>
<p>
	Producers in Mato Grosso are expected to increase their soybean acreage in 2012/13 between 800,000 and 1,000,000 hectares.  While most of increase will be the result of the conversion of pastureland into additional soybean production, a significant portion of the increase will be the result of reduced acreage of dryland rice as well as cotton.

	<p>
	Farmers in Mato Grosso continue to reduce their dryland rice acreage in favor of more soybeans in spite of improving rice prices.  The 2011/12 rice acreage in the state was 35% less than in 2010/11 and now the 2012/13 is expected to decline even further.

According to Conab, in 2011/12 the rice acreage in the state declined 37% from 256,000 hectares in 2010/11 to 161,000 hectares in 2011/12.  While the rice yields improved somewhat in 2011/12, the total production only came in at 514,600 tons, which was significantly below the 795,900 tons produced in 2010/11.

Rice acreage in the state is expected to decline even further in 2012/13 due to the superior price being paid for soybeans.  Even though rice prices in the state have increased approximately 70% compared to a year earlier, it hasn't been enough to compete with soybeans.  In August of 2011, rice was selling for R$ 25 per sack of 60 kilograms and currently it is selling for R$ 43 per sack.  Current prices of soybeans in the state are in the range of R$ 70 per sack.

Industries in the state have already started to import rice from Rio Grande do Sul to meet the domestic demand in the state.  As a result of the tight supplies, consumers in the state have seen rice prices increase 28% in just the last two weeks and prices are expected to continue moving higher.  Rice prices in the state had already increased 35 to 40% since February and they are expected to increase 10% to 15% more by the end of the year.
