Brazil Crop Production Year-end Wrap-up

<h4>2010/11 - Brazil Soybeans </h4>
<ul>
<li>Brazilian soybean farmers were very pleased with their 2010/11 soybean crop.</li>
<li>Brazil produced a record soybean crop in 2010/11 of 75.5 million tons, which was 7 million tons more than the previous year or an increase of 10%. </li>
<li>Brazilian farmers planted 24.3 million hectares of soybeans in 2010/11, up 1.8 million hectares or 8% compared to 2009/10.</li>
<li>Generally favorable weather during the growing season resulted in a record nationwide soybean yield of 3,115 kg/ha or 45.2 bu/ac.</li>
<li>Every major soybean producing state in Brazil recorded record soybean yields in 2010/11 except for the state of Mato Grosso do Sul.</li>
<li>In addition to record high yields, Brazilian soybean farmers sold their 2010/11 soybean crop for very good prices due to a disappointing soybean crop in the United States and strong demand from China.</li>
<li>Brazil exported record levels of soybeans in 2010/11 with China purchasing two thirds of Brazil's exports.</li>
</ul>


<h4>2010/11 - Brazil Corn </h4>
<ul>
<li>Farmers in Brazil were not as pleased with their 2010/11 corn crop especially the <i>safrinha</i> corn.</li>
<li>Brazil produced 57.5 million tons of corn in 2010/11, which was 3 million tons more than in 2009/10, but much lower than initial expectations at the start of the growing season.</li>
<li>The full-season corn crop turned out fairly good at 36 million tons or 62% of the total corn crop.</li>
<li>The disappointment came in the <i>safrinha</i> corn crop which is planted primarily in Mato Grosso and Parana after the early maturing soybeans are harvested.</li>
<li>Farmers planted the <i>safrinha</i> corn very late due to a delayed start in planting the soybeans and heavy rains which then delayed the soybean harvest.</li>
<li>For best results, the <i>safrinha</i> corn should be planted by the end of February, but much of the crop was not planted until later in March.</li>
<li>The <i>safrinha</i> corn crop turned out to be disappointing in Mato Grosso due to an early end of the rainy season before the crop had completed the grain filling process.</li>
<li>In Parana the <i>safrinha</i> corn crop turned out disappointing as well due to a severe freeze at the end of June that ended the growing season prematurely.</li>
<li>The <i>safrinha</i> crop ended up producing 21.5 million tons or 38% of Brazil's total corn crop.</li>
<li>Fortunately for the farmers, corn prices strengthened at the time they were selling their crop, so the higher prices partially compensated for the lower <i>safrinha</i> production.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2010/11 - Brazil Sugarcane</h4>
<ul>
<li>The one sector of Brazilian agriculture that was very disappointing in 2010/11 was the sugarcane harvest.</li>
<li>Total sugarcane tonnage in Brazil was down 10% in 2010/11.</li>
<li>Sugar production was down 3-4% and ethanol production was down a whopping 17%.</li>
<li>Sugarcane producers attribute the disappointing sugarcane yields to a number of factors including:  an extended dry season in 2010, two episodes of freezing temperatures in June and then again in August, and a lack of credit needed to renovate existing sugarcane fields resulting in an ageing sugarcane crop.</li>
<li>As a result of tight ethanol supplies, domestic ethanol prices climbed to record levels early in 2011 and Brazil needed to import ethanol to meet the domestic demand.</li>
<li>The Brazilian sugar/ethanol sector needs heavy investments over the next few years to turn around the situation.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, it will probably take several years before those investments result in a robust ethanol sector.</li>
