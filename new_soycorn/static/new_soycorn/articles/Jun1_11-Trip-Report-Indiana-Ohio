Trip Report - Indiana and Ohio
<p>
	On Sunday I toured Indiana and western Ohio with the following observations:
</p>
<h4>Indiana</h4>
<ul>
<li>The soils of Indiana are saturated with a lot of ponding and standing water.</li>
<li>There was even more rain Sunday afternoon after I had gone through the state.</li>
<li>Northern Indiana is wetter than central Indiana and the eastern half is wetter than the western half of the state.</li>
<li>Most of the corn in western Indiana is planted, in eastern Indiana there is still corn left to plant.</li>
<li>The tallest corn is in the two or three leaf stage.  </li>
<li>Plant populations look OK, but that could change with all the standing water.</li>
<li>In the ponded areas, the corn will need to be replanted after it dries out.</li>
<li>Soybean planting is most advanced in western Indiana and least advanced in eastern Indiana.</li>
<li>The soybeans in the ponded areas will also need to be replanted once it dries out.</li>
<li>Farmers planted their corn first, so now the soybean planting will have to wait for dryer conditions.</li>
<li>In the wetter areas, it will take 3-5 days to dry out enough to get back into the fields and even then, the farmers will have to work around the wet spots.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Bottom line for Indiana -</b> The biggest problem area in Indiana is probably in the northeastern quarter of the state where it is the wettest, the soils are heavier and they dry out the slowest.  There will probably be some areas that will not dry out in time before the prevented planting date arrives.  I do expect a small percentage of the Indiana corn crop not to be planted, but to be claimed under insurance instead.  
</p>
<p>
In general, the corn crop in Indiana is being planted later than normal and the ponded areas will have to be replanted once it dries out making that part of the corn crop even later.  Not all the intended corn acres will be planted in Indiana and some of the wettest areas will probably be claimed under prevented planting.
</p>
<p>

The soybean crop in Indiana is also being planted later than normal.  In the ponded areas, the soybeans will also have to be replanted.  The lateness of the soybean crop will be determined by 
when the soils dry out, but as of now, I am not too worried about planting the soybeans later than normal.  
</p>

<h4>Ohio</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ohio is a mess, everything is saturated and there is standing water everywhere.</li>
<li>I hate to say it, but the state even smells wet.</li>
<li>There is some corn planted, but most fields have not been touched.</li>
<li>Fields are full of weeds; farmers have not been able to do anything.</li>
<li>There is a lot of standing water in western Ohio and it will take a minimum of 3-5 good drying days for the farmers to get into the fields.</li>
<li>Probably less than half of the corn has been planted in the areas where I traveled with a few fields stating to emerge.</li>
<li>Some of the corn will need to be replanted after the ponded areas dry out.</li>
<li>The corn that had emerged was too small to say anything about plant populations, but I suspect that they will be less than normal due to the saturated conditions.</li>
<li>A few fields of soybeans have been planted, but I did not see any soybeans that had emerged.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Bottom line for Ohio</b> - The situation in Ohio is very serious and many areas will probably not dry out before the prevented planting date.  Certainly, some of the intended corn acres in the state will be claimed under prevent plant or is switched to soybean production.  
</p>
<p>
The corn that has been planted is very late and the crop will get even later because the ponded areas will need to be replanted.  Eventually I suspect that the plant populations will be less than normal due to a higher than normal amount of root diseases and stalk diseases.
</p>
<p>
The soybean crop in Ohio is still undetermined.  The soybeans in the state are going to be planted later than normal, but just like in Indiana, I am not too concerned about the lateness of the soybean planting in Ohio.
