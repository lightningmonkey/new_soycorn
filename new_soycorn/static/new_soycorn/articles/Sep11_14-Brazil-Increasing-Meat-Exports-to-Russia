Brazil Increasing Meat Exports to Russia
<p>
	During the first eight months of 2014, Brazil has been exporting meat to Russia at a record pace.  According to the Minister of Industrial Development and Exports (MDIC), during the first eight months of 2014 Brazil exported 370,500 tons of meat to Russia or 10.2% more than during the same period in 2013.  In total value, Brazil exported US$ 1.5 billion worth of meat thus far in 2014 or 26% more than during the same period last year.

	Going forward, the volume of meat exports to Russia is expected to increase significantly due to sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union on Russia due to Russia's involvement in the unrest in eastern Ukraine.  Russia in turn responded by imposing sanctions of its own on meat imports from the United States and Europe.

	In order to fulfil their need for meat imports, on August 7th the Russian sanitation agency quickly certified a total of 93 meat processing facilities in Brazil as being authorized to export their products to Russia including beef, pork, and poultry.

	Ironically, less than two years ago Russia suddenly prohibited meat imports from many of these same processing facilities in Brazil citing sanitary concerns.  Brazilian officials never accepted Russia's explanation for their actions and they met repeatedly with Russian officials in order to lift the ban.  When it became apparent that Russia needed Brazilian meat imports, the sanitary concerns were resolved overnight.
