<h3><h3>Ongoing Drought in U.S. Could Adversely Impact 2013 Crops</h3></h3>
<p>
	With the recent announcement that parts of the Mississippi River may be closed to shipping earlier than normal due to the near historic low water levels, it reminded everyone that the drought in the U.S. is still ongoing.  The drought has eased in parts of the eastern Corn Belt, but in the western Corn Belt, from North Dakota south to Texas, the situation has not improved and you could argue that it is getting worse.  Each week that goes by without any improvement means the overall moisture deficit in the region continues to grow.
</p>
<p>
	This has led many to wonder about what may happen in the U.S. next spring and summer.  If there are not significant and widespread snows/rains in the region over the next several months, we may be looking at a very problematic start to spring planting in March of 2013.
</p>
<p>
	This entire situation could turn into a lose-lose proposition.  I say that because in order to break the drought there would need to be heavy and widespread snowfall/rainfall over the next 3-6 months.  If that did occur, the spring planting could be delayed by saturated conditions - a losing proposition.  If there is not enough moisture to recharge the soil between now and next spring, then the 2013 growing season could start off in an even a worse condition than it did in 2012 - another losing proposition.
</p>
<p>
	In March of 2012 when temperatures were breaking records all across the Corn Belt, the general consensus was that it's going to be a very good early spring planting.  That is exactly what happened and the corn crop was planted at a record pace.  We now know that the dry conditions early last spring were just a prelude to a very hot and dry summer.
</p>
<p>
	If we get to next March and it looks again like it will be an early spring, I would say that would be a very negative development because we would be starting the growing season even dryer than we did last spring.  That would make the crops even more vulnerable to dryness later in the summer, which could be very important development especially for the corn crop.  If we learned anything from the 2012 growing season it was that in the U.S., it's the corn crop that is most susceptible to hot and dry conditions during the summer.  
</p>
<p>
	Nebraska appears to be the state most impacted by the ongoing drought.  Most of the corn produced in Nebraska is under irrigation, but there were restrictions last summer on the amount of surface water some irrigators could pump.  Since then, the situation has gotten worse and if the region does not receive significant snowfall/rainfall over the next months, there could be even more restrictions on the amount of water farmers may use next summer. 
</p>
<p>
	If the moisture deficits are not resolved by next spring, the U.S. farmers will have to weigh many factors in making their planting decisions including:  plant their corn early and risk another year of low yields due to potential drought, delay planting the corn and opt for soybeans which did much better in 2012, rotate back to more soybeans because corn-on-corn was a disaster in many areas in 2012, plant more spring wheat instead of corn because of ongoing dryness, opt for grain sorghum instead of corn, etc.  
</p>
<p>
After three straight years of disappointing crops, one thing I think we can be assured of next spring is that farmers are going to purchase as much crop insurance as possibly to protect themselves against the possibility of another disappointing summer.  From the farmer's point of view, purchasing subsidized crop insurance is much preferred to the old ad-hock system of disaster payments every time there is a crop disruption due to adverse weather.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Hard red winter wheat</b> - The crop that is currently being most impacted by the ongoing drought is the hard red winter wheat in the southern Plains.  Wheat is a very hardy grass that can withstand adverse conditions, but this year's crop is getting off to a very troubling start.  The dry weather has resulted in poor germination and stand establishment and the crop will enter dormancy in a weakened condition making it more vulnerable to winter kill and frost heaving. 
</p>
<p>
	If the crop received good moisture next spring, it could recuperate somewhat, but expectations for reduced yield prospects are probably already justified.  The best scenario for the wheat crop would be for a widespread heavy snow cover over the next several months.  That would provide needed moisture and protection from the cold temperatures.  The worst scenario would be continued dry conditions, a lack of snow cover and temperatures fluctuating above and below freezing with episodes of very cold temperatures.  That could result in excessive winter kill and frost heaving leaving the crop in very poor condition next spring.
