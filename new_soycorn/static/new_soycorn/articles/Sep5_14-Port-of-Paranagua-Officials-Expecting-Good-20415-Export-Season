Their primary source of optimism are the four new shiploaders that are currently being installed.  The first one is expected to be operational in December with the second one coming online in February.  The installation of the other two shiploaders is expected to be complete by June of 2015.  The port has been operating normally while the new shiploaders are being installed.

These new more efficient shiploaders are replacing older less efficient ones and they are part of an R$ 60 million modernization at the port.  The shiploaders being replaced were installed over 40 years ago and the new shiploaders are expected to result in a 30% increase in the port's grain loading capacity.

The old shiploaders had a capacity of 1,500 tons per hour, but in reality, they were operating closer to 800 tons per hour.  The new shiploaders have a capacity of 2,000 tons per hour.
