2012/13 Rice Harvest Starting in Brazil
<p>
	Rio Grande do Sul is the largest rice producing state in Brazil and farmers in the state have started to harvest their 2012/13 rice crop with high expectations for a good crop.  Farmers in the state planted 1.76 million hectares of rice, which was 46,000 hectares more than last growing season.  The Rio Grande do Sul Rice Institute is expecting the rice yields in the state to be equal to the last several years and in the range of 7,200 to 7,400 kg/ha and the total production in the state is expected to be 7.7 to 7.8 million tons.  If achieved, this would be the largest rice harvest in the state in two years.

Currently 100% of the rice in the state is in the reproductive phase with 20% mature and ready for harvest.  The recent dry weather in the state is not a major concern for rice producers since all the rice production in the state is irrigated.

<p>
Conab is estimating Brazil's total rice production at 12.03 million tons or 3.7% more than last year.  The total rice acreage in Brazil is essentially unchanged from last year, but nationwide yields are expected to increase 4.1%
</p>
<p>
Rio Grande do Sul is expected to produce 66% of the total rice produced in Brazil followed by Santa Catarina at 9% and Mato Grosso at 4%.  Outside of the state of Rio Grande do Sul where all the rice is irrigated, most of the remainder of rice production in Brazil is non-irrigated upland production.
