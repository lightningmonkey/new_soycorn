Most Soy Planting in Parana Should be Completed within a Week
<p>
	The state of Parana is Brazil's second largest soybean producing state and most of the farmers in the state are now in the final stage of planting their 2014/15 soybean crop.  The Department of Rural Economics (Deral) estimates that 85% of the soybeans have been planted and that planting should be complete in most of the state within a week.

	After the initial stages of planting were delayed by dry weather at the end of September and during the first half of October, the planting pace accelerated during the second half of October with improved rainfall in most of the state.  While the recent rains have generally been enough to insure planting, they have not been heavy enough to fully recharge the depleted soil moisture.  Some of the final soybeans will be planted into dry soils, but farmers are hoping that they will receive rain in time for adequate germination.

One of the last areas to plant soybeans is in the northern part of the state where rains continue to be sub-par.  The region of Cornelio Procopio has gone about two months without significant rainfall and 60% of the farmers in the region have planted their soybeans while 40% are still waiting for adequate moisture.  Farmers who are still waiting to plant soybeans will not be able to plant a second crop of corn early next year due to the delays.  Generally, safrinha corn in northern Parana needs to be planted by March 20th in order to avoid being impacted by cold weather before the crop matures.

Some of the last soybeans to be planted will be double crop soybeans planted after the wheat has been harvested.  Over five million hectares of soybeans will be planted in the state and if the weather cooperates during the growing season, statewide yields are expected to be approximately 3,000 kg/ha or 43.5 bu/ac.

The soybean crop in Parana is currently 10% germinating, 80% in vegetative development and 10% flowering.  The condition of the soybeans in the state is rated 87% good, 12% average, and 1% poor and the earliest planted soybeans will be ready to start harvesting about New Year's Day.  The bulk of the soybeans in the state though will be harvested several weeks later than normal due to the delayed planting.
