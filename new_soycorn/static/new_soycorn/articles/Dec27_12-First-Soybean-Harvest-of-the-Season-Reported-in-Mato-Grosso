<h3><h3>First Soybean Harvest of the Season Reported in Mato Grosso</h3></h3>
<p>
	The harvest of the first early-maturing soybeans started yesterday on the farm of Orcival Guimaraes in Lucas do Rio Verde in Mato Grosso.  These early harvested soybeans will be followed by a second crop of cotton.

<p>
	The soybean yields are reported to be in the range of 2,500 to 3,000 kg/ha or 36 to 43.5 bushels per acre, which is similar to the 2011/12 growing season.  The early maturing soybean yields were impacted somewhat by dryer than normal weather that occurred in October. The yields are expected to improve to 3,500 kg/ha (50 bu/ac) by the 15th of January when the medium maturity soybeans will start to be harvested.

	Farmers in the municipality of Lucas do Rio Verde generally plant the very first soybeans in Brazil and the Secretary of Agriculture in the municipality estimates that 242,000 hectares of soybeans were planted this growing season.
