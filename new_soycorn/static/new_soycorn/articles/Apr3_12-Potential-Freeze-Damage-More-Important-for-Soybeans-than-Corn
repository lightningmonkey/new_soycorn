<h3><h3>Potential Freeze Damage More Important for Soybeans than Corn</h3></h3>
<p>
	There has been quite a bit of miss-information in the media concerning potential for freeze damage to newly planted corn.  As a corn plant start to develop, the growing point of the plant remains below ground until the plant is approximately 12" tall.  This is very important because if a corn plant that is 3-4" tall is hit by freezing temperatures, it burns off the upper leaves, but it probably did not kill the growing point.  When that is the case, the plant just sprouts new leaves and the corn plant will probably still have the same yield potential as it did before the freeze.  The only way to kill the growing point while it is still below ground is to freeze the soil solid to a depth of 2-3", which is a highly unlikely event with one or two nights of below freezing temperatures.

	If the corn plant is generally a foot tall or taller when it encounters a killing frost, it is likely that the growing point will be killed and the corn will need to be replanted.  This generally does not occur unless the corn was planted sometime in April and the killing frost occurred in mid-May.  I am not a meteorologist and I do not know what the future weather will be, but after such a warm early spring, it seems highly unlikely that we could have a killing freeze in May.  The definition of a killing freeze is 28 degrees for several hours.

	Soybeans are more sensitive than corn when it comes to freezing temperatures.  The growing point of a soybean plant is above ground as soon as the cotyledons appear above the soil surface and the first leaves start to emerge.  As a result, if a small soybean plant encounters a freezing temperature, the plant is killed and it will need to be replanted.  This sensitivity to freezing temperatures is the primary reason why farmers do not want to plant their soybeans extra early.  Additionally, there is no yield benefit from planting soybeans earlier than normal.  There is generally a yield penalty if the soybeans are planted extra late, but no significant benefit if they are planted early.
