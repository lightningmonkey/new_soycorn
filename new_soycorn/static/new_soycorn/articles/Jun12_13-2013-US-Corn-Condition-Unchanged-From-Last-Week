2013 U.S. Corn Condition Unchanged from Last Week
<p>
Corn emergence as of Sunday was 85% compared to 99% last year and 92% average.  It's developing slowly not only because of the wet conditions, but also because it has consistently been colder than normal for the last several weeks.  The average corn height in Iowa is only 3-5 inches tall.  The corn crop in Iowa is a good three weeks behind in its development.  That means that some of this corn will be pollinating in early August which could be a problem not only for pollination, but also to get the crop mature before the first killing frost.

In the second condition report of the growing season, the condition of the U.S. corn crop held steady at 63% rated good to excellent.  Eight states reported that the corn condition had improved last week and eight states reported that it had declined last week.  The improvements were found mostly in the dryer states in the eastern Corn Belt and the declines were in the wetter states in the central and northwestern Corn Belt.  The five states with the best corn condition are: Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Indiana, and Tennessee.  The five states with the worst corn condition are: Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois.

These condition reports are visual observations made from afar and they must always be judged against the calendar date.  If a corn crop is judged to be in good condition on June 10th, but it is only 3 inches tall, then it is not really in good condition due to how slow the crop is developing.  I am always comparing the calendar date with the crop progress because the later the crop is developing, the higher the risk of lower yields.
