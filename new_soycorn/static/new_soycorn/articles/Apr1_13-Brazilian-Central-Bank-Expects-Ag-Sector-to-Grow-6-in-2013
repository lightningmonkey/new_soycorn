Brazilian Central Bank Expects Ag Sector to Grow 6% in 2013
<p>
	The Brazilian Central Bank is optimistic that the agricultural sector in Brazil will show healthy growth in 2013.  According to a report issued late last week by the director of the Political Economic Division of the Central Bank, Carlos Hamilton Araujo, the agricultural sector in Brazil is expected to expand 6% in 2013 after contracting 2.3% in 2012.  The problem in 2012 was a severe drought in southern Brazil that significantly reduced grain production in Brazil.  The loses were partially offset by higher commodity prices resulting from a drought in the U.S. in 2012.  The higher prices were a benefit for farmers, but it hurt the bottom line for Brazilian livestock producers.

The Central Bank expects the overall Brazilian economy to expand 3.1% in 2013 after expanding only 0.9% in 2012.  The industrial sector is expected to expand 2.3% in 2013 after contracting 0.8% last year.  The service sector is expected to expand 3.1% in 2013, which is 1.4% more than last year.

The industrial and the agricultural sectors were the two that suffered the most last year.  Brazilian grain production is expected to set a new record high in 2012/13 after farmers expanded their soybean and corn acreage and the weather during the growing season has generally been favorable.  The 2012/13 Brazilian soybean crop, which is already 70% harvested, is expected to set a new record and the corn crop has the potential to be a record as well if the weather is beneficial for the <i>safrinha</i> corn crop.  For the industrial sector, Araujo expects the reduction in interest rates and taxes to show positive results in 2013.
