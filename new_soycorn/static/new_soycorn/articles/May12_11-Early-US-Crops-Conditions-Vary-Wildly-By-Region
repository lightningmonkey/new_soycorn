<h3><h3>Early U.S. Crop Conditions Vary Widely by Regions</h3></h3>
<p>
	Since we are not going to get weekly crop condition reports for another week or so, let's take an early look at the crop conditions by region.
</p>
<h4>Eastern Corn Belt</h4>
<ul>
<li>Planting is extremely delayed in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan.</li>
<li>Nearly record slow planting in Indiana.</li>
<li>At least 10-14 days later than 2010.</li>
<li>Floodplains of rivers especially affected.</li>
<li>Not all of the intended corn acreage will be planted.</li>
<li>Additional soybean acreage may be planted.</li>
<li>Soil moisture is adequate to surplus. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Western Corn Belt</h4>
<ul>
<li>Rapid planting progress in Nebraska, Iowa, and Kansas.</li>
<li>Temperatures are warming, should encourage germination.</li>
<li>Planting intensions probably will remain unchanged; corn acreage might even be higher than intended.</li>
<li>Soil moisture in region generally adequate.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Northwestern Corn Belt</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cold wet conditions persist especially in N. Dakota. </li>
<li>Farmers in North Dakota just now getting into fields.</li>
<li>Most progress in southwestern Minnesota.</li>
<li>Not all of intended spring wheat acreage will be planted.</li>
<li>Probably not all the corn acreage will be planted.</li>
<li>Additional soybean acreage in the region.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Southern Corn Belt and mid-South</h4>
<ul>
<li>Extensive flooding along rivers.</li>
<li>Floodplains could have standing water for weeks.</li>
<li>Most of the corn planted on time but now some has been flooded out.</li>
<li>Corn plant populations reduced.</li>
<li>Some corn acreage lost, probably will be too late to replant.</li>
<li>Cotton planting delayed as well, could approach prevent plant date.</li>
<li>Rice planting delayed.</li>
<li>Soybean acreage should increase due to delays in corn, cotton and rice planting.</li>
<li>Soil moisture adequate to saturated.</li>
</ul>
