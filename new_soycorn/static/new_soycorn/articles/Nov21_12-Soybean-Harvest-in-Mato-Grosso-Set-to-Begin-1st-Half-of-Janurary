Soybean Harvest in Mato Grosso Set to Begin 1st Half of January
<p>
	In their latest evaluation of the planting progress in the state, the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) estimates that soybean planting is nearly complete in the northern part of the state (95%) with 90% of the soybeans planted in western Mato Grosso, 80% planted in the southeastern region, 69% in the central-south region, 66% in the south, and 40% in northeastern Mato Grosso.

Now that the soybean planting is nearly complete in parts of Mato Grosso, the start of the soybean harvest can also be estimated as well.  In the municipality of Lucas do Rio Verde, located in central Mato Grosso, the soybean harvest should begin during the first half of January or about January 5th to the 10th.  In the municipality of Sinop, located in northern Mato Grosso, the soybean planting was delayed by dry weather, so the harvest should begin during the second half of January or about January 15th to the 20th.

Farmers in the state can be certain about the timing of the start of the harvest because many of the early maturing soybeans are forced into maturity through the use of desiccants.  Once a desiccant is applied, the leaves drop off the plant, the stems dry down and the crop is ready for harvest in 7-10 days depending on the weather.  Trying to harvest soybeans in January, which is generally the peak of the rainy season, can be a tricky proposition.  By using desiccants, farmers can more directly control when the soybean harvest will take place.

There might be a few fields of soybeans in Mato Grosso harvested by New Year's Day, but the volume of harvested soybeans will be small until about the middle of January.
