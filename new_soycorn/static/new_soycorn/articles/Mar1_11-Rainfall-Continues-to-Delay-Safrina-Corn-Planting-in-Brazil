Rainfall Continues to Delay Safrinha Corn Planting in Brazil
<p>
	The slow pace of the soybean harvest in Mato Grosso has also resulted in slow planting of the <i>safrinha</i> corn crop in the state.  According to Imea, the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics, 45% of the <i>safrinha</i> corn has been planted compared to 85% last year.

The official planting window for the <i>safrinha</i> corn crop in Mato Grosso is now closed (it closed the last week of February) and less than half of the intended crop has been planted.  There is a high likelihood that not all the intended <i>safrinha</i> corn acreage in Mato Grosso (1.81 million hectares) will be planted and the corn that is planted will have a greater risk of yield reductions due to how late it will be planted.  Generally, the rainy season ends in early May and if that would be the case this year as well, the later planted corn could run out of soil moisture before it completed the grain filling process.

The <i>safrinha</i> corn planting in Parana is also behind schedule due to the delayed soybean harvest, but their ideal planting window won't close until about March 20th, so there is still time to plant the corn provided that the rains start to diminish.

	The <i>safrinha</i> corn crop now accounts for approximately 40% of all the corn produced in Brazil.  Mato Grosso has the largest <i>safrinha</i> corn acreage followed by the state of Parana.
