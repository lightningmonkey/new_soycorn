State of Parana Leads Soybean Planting Pace in Brazil
<p>
	A week of sunny weather allowed farmers in Parana to make rapid progress in planting their 2013/14 soybean crop last week.  The soybean and corn crops in Parana are approaching 50% planted, which is about 5% faster than last year and the three year average.  The soybean planting in Parana is the most advanced of any of the major soybean producing states in Brazil.  In parts of western Parana, the spring planting is nearing completion.  The most advanced corn in Parana is approaching 10 inches tall and the most advanced soybeans are 6 inches tall.

In Mato Grosso do Sul approximately 45% of the spring crops have been planted.  Farmers in Parana and Mato Grosso do Sul plant both corn and soybeans in the spring, but in Mato Grosso very little corn is planted this time of the year with nearly all the corn planted as a double crop after the soybeans are harvested.

Nationwide, the 2013/14 Brazilian soybean crop is approximately 25% complete.
