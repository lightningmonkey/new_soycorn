Safrinha Harvest 82% Complete in Mato Grosso, 42% in Parana
<p>
	Farmers in both Mato Grosso and Parana are making good progress in harvesting their 2013 <i>safrinha</i> corn crop.  According to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) farmers in the state have harvested approximately 82% of the corn compared to 90% the same time last year.

	Mato Grosso is the largest <i>safrinha</i> producing state in Brazil and Imea is now estimating a statewide average yield of 99 sacks per hectare (5,940 kg/ha or 91 bu/ac) compared to 103 sacks per hectare in 2012 (6,180 kg/ha or 95 bu/ac).  In their latest monthly report, Conab has pegged the <i>safrinha</i> corn crop in the state at 18.6 million tons and for Brazil as a whole at 44.2 million tons.

	Parana is the second largest <i>safrinha</i> corn producing state and the Department of Rural Economics (Deral) estimates that 42% of the 2013 <i>safrinha</i> corn has been harvested.  This is slightly ahead of last year's 37% and the three year average of 33%.

	The freezing temperatures experienced across the state during the last week of July may negatively impact some of the later developing corn in the northern part of the state that had not yet reached black layer, which is when the grain is safe from frost.  Agronomists for Deral feel that their current projection of 11 million ton production may be revised downward in their next report.

	Farmers in Mato Grosso are also in the process of harvesting their cotton crop which is 44% harvested or an advance of 11% from last week.
