<h3><h3>Soybean Rust Lowers Yields in Mato Grosso</h3></h3>
<p>
	The soybean harvest is nearly complete in Mato Grosso and many farmers ended up being disappointed with their 2011/12 soybean yields.  The main culprit appears to have been soybean rust especially in the northern regions of the state.  After two growing season when the diseases had a minimal impact on the soybean crop in the state, this year the disease is blamed for loses in the range of 10-15%  in the most severe cases.

	The disease appears to have been worse in the northern part of the state and especially on soybeans that were planted late.  The disease first started to appear in late December and early January when the rainfall increased.  Unfortunately, heavy rains during January helped to spread the disease rapidly and the rains frustrated farmer's attempts to apply fungicides.

Many farmers reported that they spent 10% more on disease and pest control compared to a normal year.  These lower yields are particularly disappointing to farmers who expanded their soybean acreage by converting degraded pastures to additional soybean production.  In those cases they spent an extra amount of money on land preparation and increased fertilizer use only to see their yields negatively impacted by soybean rust.

The 2010/11 soybean crop in Mato Grosso set a record so anything short of last year's yields seems like a disappointment.  The municipality of Sorriso, which is located in central Mato Grosso, is the largest soybean producing municipality in Brazil and in 2010/11 their yields averaged 58 sacks per hectare or 50.5 bu/ac.  This year the yields are expected to be in the range of 54/55 sacks per hectare or 47 to 48 bu/ac, which is lower than last year but still above the expected statewide average of 52 sacks per hectare or 45 bu/ac.
