<h3><h3>Brazilian Safrinha Soybean Production being Questioned</h3></h3>
<p>
	A commission of scientists from the Plant Protection Division of the Ministry of Agriculture for the state of Mato Grosso (CDSV) is studying the possibility of prohibiting the planting of <i>safrinha</i> soybeans in the state starting as early as the 2014/15 growing season.  Opinions on a prohibition are divided and no timetable has been set on when a recommendation will be made.
</p>
<p>
	Those in favor of a prohibition are concerned that the second crop of soybeans allows for the propagation of diseases and insects for a longer period of time which then raises the risks of increased infestations when the next soybean crop is planted during the second half of September.  The two pests that scientists are most worried about are soybean rust and the corn earworm.
</p>
<p>
Of all the potential crops planted after the soybeans are harvested (corn, soybeans, cotton, sunflowers, sorghum, etc.) a second crop of soybeans are the most susceptible for increased pest pressures.  In addition to the potential for increased pests, a second crop of soybeans is also at risk from dry weather during the pod filling period.
</p>
<p>
	During the first crop of soybeans fungicides may have to be applied every 15 days to control soybean rust or up to eight applications during the growing season.  These heavy fungicide applications can result in the development of fungicide resistant strains of soybean rust.  When a second crop of soybeans is planted back-to-back, even more fungicides need to be applied with the potential for even more resistant strains of the disease evolving.
</p>
<p>
	It is estimated that 120,000 hectares of <i>safrinha</i> soybeans were planted in Mato Grosso after the first crop of soybeans were harvested in January and February.  No official estimates of the soybean yields have been released but antidotal accounts point to high levels of disease and insect infestation and low yields.  In some of the hardest hit fields, soybean yields are very low in the range of 10 to 15 sacks per hectare (600 to 900 kg/ha or 9 to 13 bu/ac).  The average statewide yield for the first crop of soybeans was 52 sacks per hectare (3,120 kg/ha or 45.2 bu/ac).
</p>
<p>
	The Mato Grosso Soybean and Corn Producers Association (Aprosoja/MT) has taken a wait and see attitude toward <i>safrinha</i> soybean production.  They want more research conducted to see if scientists’ fears are justified.  They do not want to limit their member’s options, but at the same time, they think farmers should be a "good neighbor" and not plant a crop with a limited potential for financial return that could in the end result in high costs for their neighbors.
</p>
<p>
	Farmers in the municipality of Campo Novo do Parecis in western Mato Grosso have avoided some of these potential problems by focusing their second crop efforts on producing sunflowers and popcorn.  The municipality plants 100,000 hectares of sunflowers and 40,000 hectares of popcorn after the harvest of the first crop of soybeans.
