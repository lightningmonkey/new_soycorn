<h3><h3>2014/15 Brazil Sugarcane Harvest Limping to a Disappointing Close</h3></h3>
<p>
	The disappointing 2014/15 sugarcane harvest in southern Brazil is limping to a close.  During the second half of November, the sugar mills in southern Brazil processed 15.7 million tons of sugarcane which is 40% less than during the second half of November in 2013.  For the entire 2014/15 harvest season thus far through the end of November, there have been 571 million tons of sugarcane processed in southern Brazil or 3% less than last year.
</p>
<p>
	According to the Union of Sugarcane Industries (Unica), 136 sugar mills have closed down operations for the season due to a lack of sugarcane compared to 73 that had closed by the end of November in 2013.  The early closing of mills is a reflection of the reduced sugarcane production especially in the state of Sao Paulo.  The reduced production is the result of a drought last December and January and an extended dry season during September and October.

<p>
The Center for Sugarcane Technologies (CTC) is reporting that the sugarcane harvested in southern Brazil during the month of November averaged 63.5 tons per hectare or 15% less than during November of 2013.  For the entire harvest season through the end of November, the sugarcane yields in southern Brazil are down 7.8% with the state of Sao Paulo down 11% (73.8 tons per hectare in 2014/15 compared to 83.8 tons per hectare in 2013/14).

<p>
	The Total Recoverable Sugars thus far during the 2014/15 harvest season is 137.4 kg/ton, which is actually a little higher (+2.6%) compared to the 131.7 kg/ha registered in 2013/14.
</p>
<p>
	The total sugar produced in southern Brazil through the end of November was 31.5 million tons or 4.9% less than the 33.1 million tons produced in 2013/14.  In addition to low sugarcane yields, processors are also directing more of their sugarcane for ethanol production (56.5%) compared to sugar production.  In fact, during the second half of November, 63% of the sugarcane processed in southern Brazil went toward ethanol production.
</p>
<p>
	From April 1st through November 30th, the ethanol producers in southern Brazil have sold 16.3 billion liters of ethanol or 6.9% less than during the same period last year.  This reduction is primarily a reflection of falling ethanol exports which totaled only 957 million liters thus far in 2014/15 compared to 2.15 billion liters of exports in 2013/14 or a reduction of 55%.
