<h3><h3>Sorghum and Millet are Alternatives to Safrinha Corn Production</h3></h3>
<p>
	Instead of planning corn as a <i>safrinha</i>crop, a number of farmers in Mato Grosso opted to plant grain sorghum or millet as their second crop.  Both of these crops are much more drought tolerant than corn and are a viable option when planting is delayed as it has been this year.  Yields and prices for grain sorghum and millet are lower than what they are for corn, but the initial investment is much lower as well.  The earlier planted grain sorghum is already headed out, but most of the crop is still in vegetative development.  The sorghum and millet crops are in good condition and should be able to withstand the impending dry weather better than corn.
