Brazil Company to Export Pork Directly to China
<p>
	The Brazilian company, Seara Alimentos, will make its first shipment of port products directly to China next week.  The volume of pork will be small, but a company spokesman said this is the first of what is destined to be much larger volumes of pork sent directly to China.  The pork will be shipped to Shanghai and distributed locally by a domestic distributor.

	The majority of Brazilian pork currently being exported to China arrives indirectly through Hong Kong, which is the second leading destination of Brazilian pork after Russia.

	Marfrig, which acquired Seara Alimentos in 2009, is the second leading producer of pork, poultry, and beef in Brazil.  The company already exports other type of meats to China, but this will be the first direct shipment of pork to China.  The pork will be produced and processed at Seara owned facilities in Santa Catarina.

Two other pork processing facilities have been authorized by China to export meat to China, one owned by Brasil Foods and the other owned by Aurora.  These authorizations were the result of meeting between the Brazilian president, Dilma Rousseff, and Chinese officials back in April of 2011.  China is already the major importer of agricultural products from Brazil.

In 2012, Hong Kong and China should surpass Russia as the number one destination of Brazilian pork.
