<h3><h3>The Opening of the Soybean Planting Season Slated for Thursday</h3></h3>
<p>
	Later this week a ceremony marking the official opening of the soybean planting season will be held in the city of Sinop in northern Mato Grosso.  These official opening ceremonies are an opportunity for researchers and politicians to assess the state of soybean production in Brazil.  There will be two days of forums and meeting discussing:  the latest soybean technologies, how to improve soybean yields, the conversion of pastureland into soybean production, how to combat the latest diseases and pests, and the government's efforts to improve Brazil's infrastructure.  These ceremonies are often attended by leading agribusiness personnel, national experts in soybean production, and state and national politicians.

	Sinop was chosen for the opening ceremonies because it is one of the large expansion areas of soybean production in Mato Grosso.  Up until the year 2000, timber products were the principal products driving the local economy, but that has now changed to soybeans and cattle production.  In fact, Embrapa researchers will be front and center in the meetings promoting their latest research on ways to integrate row crops, cattle ranching, and reforestation.  The researchers feel this is the best path forward for sustainable soybean production in the state while at the same time limiting deforestation.

	The city of Sinop is on the southern edge of the Amazon Forest and the area is closely watched by environmental groups interested in reducing deforestation in the Amazon Region.  Deforestation is a leading source of greenhouse gas emissions in Brazil and the government has been working toward reducing deforestation as a way to achieve its goals of reduced emissions.
