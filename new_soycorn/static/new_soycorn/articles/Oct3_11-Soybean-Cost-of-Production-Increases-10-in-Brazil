<h3><h3>Soybean Cost of Production Increases 10% in Brazil</h3></h3>
<p>
	The cost of growing soybeans in central Brazil has increased 10% in 2011/12 compared to a year ago.  According to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea), the typical producer in Mato Grosso will spend R$ 1,655 per hectare to produce his soybeans in 2011/12.  Of this total, R$ 1,504 are operational costs such as planting, harvesting, and inputs.

	The principal reason for the rising costs was the increased price for inputs which rose 23% in 2011.  The cost of fertilizers increased the most and fertilizers are very important for soybean production in the <i>cerrado</i> regions of Brazil.  
</p>
<p>
	In compensation for higher prices, the recent weakening of the Brazilian real compared to the U.S. dollar has been very beneficial for Brazilian farmers because with a weaker currency they put more money in their pockets every time they sell a sack of soybeans.  Farmers have been very aggressive in forward selling their 2011/12 soybean production.  Imea estimates that approximately 50% of the anticipated production has already been sold.  This is much faster than last year when 36% had been sold by this date.

<p>
Imea estimates that soybean acreage in Mato Grosso will increase 3.4% to 6.4 million hectares.  Most of the increase came as the result of conversions of pastures to soybeans.  Total production for the state is estimated at 21 million tons or 2.3% more than 2010/11.  Slightly lower yields are expected this growing season due to the incorporation of new lands which are generally lower yielding for the first few years of production.
</p>
<p>
Rainfall amounts have been increasing in Mato Grosso over the last two weeks and many farmers have now started to plant their 2011/12 soybean crop.  Imea estimated late last week that 1% of the crop had been planted, but that number will quickly increase.
