What Would it Take to Have a Corn Yield Above 160 bu/ac?
<p>
	We already know that the corn is going to be planted later than normal, which will push the pollination later into the summer and require a late fall to allow enough time for the corn crop to mature.  Therefore, I would estimate that there is maybe a 20% possibility that the corn yield could be 160 bu/ac or higher, but it would require a number of things to occur including: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>No more significant delays during May in getting the majority of the corn planted in the central Corn Belt.</li>
<li>Flooding in eastern North Dakota and western Minnesota ending in early May allowing enough time to plant corn before the end of May.</li>
<li>A gradual warm up to near normal summer temperatures.  A sudden warm up could turn "mud into bricks" which would impede crop establishment.</li> 
<li>A cooler than normal summer with no prolonged periods of extreme heat especially during pollination and early grain filling.</li>
<li>Cool nighttime temperatures which would inhibit dark respiration.  Dark respiration is the yield-robing condition that occurs when nighttime temperatures remain elevated.</li>
<li>A warm and dry early fall with a later than normal first frost.</li>
</ul>
