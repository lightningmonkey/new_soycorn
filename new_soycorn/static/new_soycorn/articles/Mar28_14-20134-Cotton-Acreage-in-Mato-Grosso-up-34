2013/14 Cotton Acreage in Mato Grosso up 34%
<p>
	The 2013/14 cotton acreage in the state of Mato Grosso is expected to be up 34% compared to the previous growing season.  The Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) is estimating that 604,000 hectares of cotton was planted in the state compared to 452,000 hectares in 2012/13.  The split between full-season and <i>safrinha</i> cotton is about the same as last year with 70% planted as a second crop and 30% planted as full-season.

The average yield in 2013/14 is expected to be 1,492 kg/ha or slightly less than the 1,519 kg/ha achieved last year.  The lower yields are due to delayed plating caused by wet weather earlier in the year.  The latest planted cotton could encounter moisture deficits later in its development which could impact yields.

The total cotton production in the state is expected to increase 31% to 902,500 tons compared to last year's production of 687,000 tons.
