Reaction to USDA's August Crop Report
<p>
	With the release of the August Crop Report last Friday, we now have a starting point from which to evaluate the USDA's crop estimates.  The 2012 U.S. corn yield was estimated at 123.4 bu/ac, which I thought was OK, but there were other components of the total production estimate that I thought were not OK including:  harvested acreage, ears per acre, and the harvest loss.  
</p>
<p>
<b>Harvested acreage</b> - The corn harvested acreage was estimated at 87.4 million acres, which I think is too high.  Using that figure, then 90.7% of the planted corn would be harvested for grain, which would be only slightly below the five year average.  Given the amount of extra corn needed for silage this year and the very poor condition of the corn crop; I feel they have overestimated the corn harvested acreage.  
</p>
<p>
When will we know the final harvested acreage?  The final corn harvested acreage will be determined by future crop surveys and the data gathered by the Farm Services Administration as far as the number of acres claimed under crop insurance.  Since the corn crop is maturing earlier than normal this year, the claim adjusters have been in the field earlier than normal as well.  But their workload is going to be much greater than normal this year, so it is going to take longer to get all the claims settled this year.  Only after all the data is collected concerning abandonment will the USDA have an accurate estimate of the final corn harvested acreage.  
</p>
<p>
Generally, the crop insurance data is not available until the October Crop Report.  This year though, the USDA may get an early indication of how many acres may be abandoned when they conduct the farmer survey for the September Crop Report.  By September 1st, farmers should have a very good idea about how much corn will be abandoned. 
</p>
<p>
The USDA may lower the corn harvested acreage in the September Crop Report, but a more accurate estimate will come with the October Crop Report.  Until then, I will continue to use a corn harvested acreage of 83.0 million acres.  
</p>
<p>
The situation for soybeans is very similar.  The USDA is using a harvested acreage of 74.6 million acres, which would be 98.0% of the planted acreage.  If verified, that would be only slightly less than average, which seems very optimistic given the type of weather we have had this summer.  Unfortunately, we won't know the final soybean harvested acreage until the October report.  Until then, I will continue to use a soybean harvested acreage of 73.3 million acres.
</p>
<p>
<b>Ear count per acre</b> - The USDA indicated that their survey found the third highest number of ears per acre on record for the ten objective yield states (IL, IN, IA, KS, MN, MO, NE, OH, SD, and WI).  This seems very optimistic given the worst drought in decades, but I think I know they came up with a high ear count.  The plant population this year is very high due to the good spring planting weather.  Therefore, germination and stand establishment was high as well resulting in a high plant population.  
</p>
<p>
For the August Crop Report, the survey teams count the number of plants in their plots and if those plants have an ear.  They generally do not look inside the ear to see if it will be a viable ear because the ear development has generally not reached that point of development.  So my guess is that the high plant population resulted in a high number of ears per acre as well, but this year, not all of those small ears will develop into a viable ear.  They won't know that until the September or October survey when they open up the ear, count the kernels, and then eventually weigh the ear.  Therefore, in subsequent crop reports, I expect the ear counts will decline.  
</p>
<p>
	<b>Harvest loss</b> - They also indicated in the report that they used the average harvest loss to calculate the final yield.  The harvest loss is the number of kernels or seeds left on the ground during the harvest process.  This could result from ears dropping off the plant prematurely before harvest, plants being blown over by strong winds or wet snow, running the combine at too fast of a speed, the combine not being adjusted properly, light weight and small kernels being blown out the back of the combine, or all the above.  
</p>
<p>
	This year I think the harvest loss will be greater than normal due to the higher amount of very small ears and light weight and small kernels.  A combine is adjusted to harvest a normal size ear and it is possible that some of these small "nubbin" ears may not even get into the combine, but instead fall on the ground.  Certainly there are more of these small ears this year compared to a normal year.
</p>
<p>
	There is the potential for increased harvest losses for soybeans as well.  The source of increased losses for soybeans is the fact that many soybean plants are very short, which makes it more difficult to get the plant into the combine.  As the cutter bar cuts off a very short soybean plant, it may just fall onto the ground instead of being brought into the combine, thus greater harvest loss.
</p>
<p>
	The survey teams will not calculate the actual harvest loss until the entire field has been harvested.  Therefore, this is an adjustment to the overall yield that we won't know about until probably the October or November reports.
