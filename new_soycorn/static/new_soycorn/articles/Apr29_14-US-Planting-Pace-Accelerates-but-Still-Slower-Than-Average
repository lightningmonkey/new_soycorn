U.S. Planting Pace Accelerates, but Still Slower than Average
<p>
	The weather was relatively good last week especially in the more southern locations and as a result 19% of the corn has now been planted compared to 5% last year and 28% for the five year average.   The most advanced corn planting is in Louisiana with 98% of the corn planted, Mississippi has 75%, Arkansas has 74%, and Texas has 64%.

	In the heart of the Corn Belt Illinois leads the way with 32% of the corn planted followed by Nebraska at 20% and Iowa at 15%.  As you would expect, the slowest planting is in the northern Corn Belt where North Dakota has planted 0% of the corn, Minnesota has 4% planted and South Dakota has 11% planted.

Three percent of the soybeans have been planted which is just slightly behind the average of 4%.

A few Midwestern states such as Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, and South Dakota are either about equal to the five-year average or slightly ahead of average.  While last week was relatively good for planting, the planting progress this week is expected to be much slower.  A slow moving storm system will result in multiple days of wet weather in the Midwest accompanied by cool temperatures.  Many areas will see little planting progress until later this week.

The early planting pace is slower than average, but still ahead of last year's pace and given the wet forecast for this week, the planting pace will fall even further behind the average in next Monday's report.
