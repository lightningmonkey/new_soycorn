U.S. Planting Continues to be Hindered by Cold and Wet Weather
<p>
	Record heavy springtime snow and rain kept farmers out of the fields last week in much of the central Corn Belt.  Warmer and dryer weather allowed for some planting to progress in the eastern Corn Belt and far western regions of the Corn Belt, but even for the farmers who did not receive heavy precipitation in the western Corn Belt, the cold temperatures discouraged a rapid planting pace.

As of Sunday, 12% of the 2013 corn crop has been planted compared to 69% last year and 47% average.  Most of last week's planting progress occurring in the eastern and southern Corn Belt as well as a little in the western Corn Belt.  Kentucky had 32% of its corn planted, Missouri 22%, but it was much less in the heart of the Corn Belt with Ohio at 7%, Indiana 8%, Illinois 7%, Iowa 8%.  A little more was planted in the western Corn Belt with Nebraska at 14% and Kansas at 17%.

The forecast is calling for a few days of improved planting conditions before another round of wet weather advances across the central Corn Belt later this week, but improved planting weather is expected in the 6-10 day forecast.  If the forecast verifies, next week should be a big planting week in the central Corn Belt.  It looks like much of the corn in the central Corn Belt will eventually be planted about two weeks later than average, if the weather cooperates during the second half of May.
