<h3><h3>Farmers in Parana Wrapping up Corn and Soybean Planting</h3></h3>
<p>
	The state of Parana is the second leading producer of soybeans and corn in Brazil and farmers in the state have essentially now completed the planting of their 2014/15 spring crops.  The Department of Rural Economics (Deral) indicated that the 535,000 hectares of full-season corn is now all planted.  This represents a reduction of 20% in full-season corn acreage compared to last year when 665,000 hectares were planted.  Farmers opted to plant less corn and instead more soybeans.

	The southern part of the state accounts for about 60% of the full-season acreage in the state, but irregular rainfall in the region has led to concerns about the potential corn yields.  The rains have improved recently and the full-season corn crop in the state is now rated as 84% good, 15% average, and 1% poor.  The full-season corn in Parana is 72% in vegetative development, 22% pollinating, and 5% in grain filling.

	Soybeans are the most important crop in the state and the 2014/15 soybean crop is 98% planted according to Deral.  Dry pockets in the northern part of the state has led to lower crop rating for soybeans in that region.  In the municipality of Ivaipora in northern Parana, the soybeans are rated at only 60% good, but statewide the crop is rated 85% good.
