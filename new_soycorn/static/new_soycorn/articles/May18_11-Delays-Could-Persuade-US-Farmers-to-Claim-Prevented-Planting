Delays Could Persuade U.S. Farmers to Claim Prevented Planting
<p>
	With the delays in planting the U.S. corn crops, there is a lot of interest in the prevented planting dates and if some farmers will claim prevented planting instead of risking a late planted corn crop.  The prevented planting date can vary from state to state and even by county within a state, but some generalizations can be made. 
</p>
<p>
For the Midwestern states, the earliest prevented planting date for corn is in Kansas on May 20 and the latest prevented planting date is June 10 in Pennsylvania.  The majority of states in the Midwest have a prevented planting date for corn of between May 25 and May 31.
</p>
<p>
	For soybeans, the earliest prevented planting date is June 10 in the northwestern Corn Belt and the latest prevented planting date is June 30 in Kansas.  The majority of states in the Midwest have a prevented planting date for soybeans of between June 15 and June 20.

Some of the general rules involving prevented planting include:
</p>
<ui>
<li>You must have been prevented from planting by an insured cause (usually too wet).</li>
<li>The condition must be common to the area.  Others in the area must have had experienced the same problem.</li>
<li>The area that could not be planted must be at least 20% of an insured area.  The area that was prevented from being planted does not need to be contiguous.</li>
<li>The indemnity will be 60% of your guarantee.  In other words, if you elected 75% coverage, then you will receive a guarantee of 75% of your Actual Production History.  If you chose Crop Revenue Coverage, then your prevented planting indemnity would be 60% of the 75%. </li>
<li>You cannot plant any crop including a cover crop during the late planted period which is 25 days after the final planting date for corn and soybeans.</li>
<li>If you plant any crop during the late planting period, you do not have a prevented planting claim.</li>
<li>If you plant a second crop after the late planting period has ended, you will receive only 35% of the prevented planting indemnity and you must insure the second crop and pay the full premium on the second crop.</li>
<li>You must submit a notice of loss on a prevented planting claim within 72 hours of the time that you determined that you will not be able to plant the crop, but no later than 72 hours after the end of the late planted period.</li>

</ul>
