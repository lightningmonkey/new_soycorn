Rains in Central Brazil helps Replenish Soil Moisture
<p>
These surprising rains in central Brazil will go a long way toward replenishing some of the lost soil moisture that traditionally reaches its low point in August.  This is actually very good news for soybean farmers in the region.  They are allowed to start planting soybeans on September 15th, which is the expiration of the 90-day soybean free period, but generally there is not enough soil moisture in mid-September to start planting.

Most farmers would like to see at least two inches or more of rain before they risk planting their soybeans, but with the volume of rain they have received over the past week, farmers may be more able to start planting their soybeans as soon as permissible this year.

I am no meteorologists and I do not know if rainfall in July is a precursor to an early start to the rainy season or not.  We won't know when the rainy season will start until probably September, but significant rains at the end of July is certainly very welcome news for farmers in Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Goias, and Minas Gerais.
