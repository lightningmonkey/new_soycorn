Soybean Planting Surges Ahead in Mato Grosso 
<p>
	The soybean planting pace in Mato Grosso has accelerated after a week of good rainfall.  According to Imea (the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics), soybean planting in the state is 22% complete, which is 15% ahead of last year's pace.  The planting pace is most advanced in the north-central region of the state where 34% of the crop has been planted and in the western region of the state where 24% has been planted.

	Forty percent of the soybean acreage in Mato Grosso is concentrated in the north-central municipalities of Nova Mutum, Lucas do Rio Verde, Sorriso, Sinop, and Tapurah.  These are also the municipalities where much of the <i>safrinha</i> corn is produced as well.  Therefore, if the soybeans get planted in a timely fashion in these municipalities, then the <i>safrinha</i> corn should get planted on time as well.  This is very important for the corn because timely planting is the number one determining factor for <i>safrinha</i> corn yields in Mato Grosso.

	In the western region of the state, much of the soybeans will be followed by a second crop of cotton.  Cotton has a longer growing cycle than corn, so getting the cotton planted as early as possible in January is critical in achieving optimum cotton yields.  Farmers in the region are planting early-maturing soybeans that will be harvested in January allowing enough time for the cotton to be planted before the cotton planting window closes at the end of January.

	Imea is estimating that farmers in the state will plant 6.8 million hectares of soybeans which is 6.3% more than in 2010/11.  The total soybean production in the state is expected to be 21.5 million tons or 4.4% more than 2010/11.
