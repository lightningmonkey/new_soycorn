<h3><h3>2011/12 Corn Planting Has Starting in the Southern Hemisphere</h3></h3>
<p>
	Farmers in Rio Grande do Sul have started to plant their 2011/12 corn crop.  In the northern municipalities of the state the conditions have been favorable for field work and now that the temperatures have increased, farmers have started to plant their 2011/12 corn crop.  Many farmers plant a winter cover crop which must be desiccated before the corn can be planted.

Farmers in Brazil are anxious to plant their corn in anticipation of even stronger corn prices when they start to harvest the corn in early 2012.

	The Minister of Agriculture in Argentina has also indicated that farmers in northern Argentina started to plant their 2011/12 corn crop last week.  Corn in Argentina can be planted until December and strong corn prices have encouraged Argentine farmers to increase their intended corn acreage for 2011/12.

The extension service in the state of Rio Grande do Sul has indicated that the wheat crop in the state is developing normally.  In its weekly report, they indicated that 84% of the wheat is in vegetative development, 15% is flowering, and 3% is in grain formation.  All the wheat in the state will be followed by double crop soybeans when the wheat is harvested.

The Minister of Agriculture in Argentina recently lowered its estimate of the 2011/12 wheat acreage by 200,000 hectares from 4.7 million to 4.5 million due to dry weather in southern Buenos Aires province.
