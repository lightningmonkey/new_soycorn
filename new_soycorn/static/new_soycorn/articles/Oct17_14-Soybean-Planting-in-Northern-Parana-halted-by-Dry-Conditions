Soybean Planting in Northern Parana halted by Dry Conditions
<p>
	Parana is the second leading soybean producing state in Brazil and recent hot and dry weather in the northern part of the state have convinced farmers to halt their soybean planting while they wait for additional rainfall.  Near the city of Londrina in northern Parana, farmers have planted approximately 40,000 hectares of soybeans, but no planting has occurred in recent days.  Additionally, germination is reported to be poor for the few soybeans that have already been planted due to the excessive soil temperatures.

Officials from the Integrada Cooperative located in Londrina, indicated that all planting has been halted while farmers wait for rain and that some of the earlier planted soybeans may have to be replanted as well.  One of the problems is the excessive temperatures in the region.  Technicians from the cooperative measured the soil temperature at the one inch depth on exposed soil and found it to be above 60 degrees C (140 degrees F).  The high temperatures and lack of moisture can result in death of the newly emerged soybeans.

If the soybeans are replanted at the end of October, they can still have a normal yield potential, but only if the weather during the growing season cooperates.  There are showers in the forecast for next week, but substantial rainfall is not expected in the region until the last week of October.

Farmers in the region planted their corn earlier when the soil moisture was adequate for germination and stand establishment.  As a result, the corn is coping with the current adverse weather better than the soybeans.  The corn is in vegetative development and it too will need additional rainfall if the crop is to continue developing normally.

In the area serviced by the Coamo Cooperative, which is the largest in the state, the soybean acreage is expected to increase 3.4% while the full-season corn acreage is expected to decline 13%.  The members of the cooperative have planted 85% of their corn and the planting will be completed as soon as the next rain arrives.
