<h3><h3>Brazil Beef Exporters Looking for New Markets</h3></h3>
<p>
	Brazilian beef exporters have already surpassed their goal of exporting R$ 6 billion in 2013 and they are now setting their sights on exporting R$ 8 billion worth of products 2014.  If achieved, it would come on the heels of a 12% increase in 2013.

According to the Brazilian Association of Meat Exporting Industries (ABIEC), that goal will only be reached if they are able to replicate the type of success they have recently had with Hong Kong and Venezuela.   Hong Kong is the number one destination of Brazilian beef and Venezuela is number four and these two countries have increased their imports of Brazilian beef by 70% and 86% respectively in 2013.

	The president of ABIEC, Antonio Jorge Camardeli, recently stated that they continue to be very active in promoting Brazilian beef and that they will receive delegations from China in December and Saudi Arabia in February, both of which are looking to import more beef.  Additionally they have been negotiating with American buyers with the hope of exporting more products to the U.S.  ABIEC has been working in association with the Brazilian Export and Promotion Association to promote Brazilian beef in other markets sending delegations to food marketing fairs across the world.

The top ten importers of Brazilian beef include:  Hong Kong, Russia, European Union, Venezuela, Egypt, Chile, U.S., Iran, Algeria, and Israel.
