<h3><h3>Corn Earworms may Require Multiple Insecticide Applications</h3></h3>
<p>
	As farmers in Brazil continue to plant their 2013/14 soybean crop, they are also on the lookout for the presence of the corn earworm and they are finding the insect all across Brazil.  The insect (<i>Helicoverpa armigera</i>) gained fame last growing season in the state of Bahia where it caused significant damage to the soybean, cotton, and corn crops in the state.  
</p>
<p>
In Mato Grosso, which is the largest soybean producing state in Brazil, the soybean planting is about 75% complete and there are reports of farmers already spraying multiply times for the insect.  It is estimated that some farmers in the state may have to double their insecticide applications to control the caterpillar and the chemicals used are generally more expensive.  Farmers in Mato Grosso who would normally make four insecticide applications per growing season may now have to do up to seven applications.  It is estimated that each application will cost between R$ 20 to R$ 30 per hectare or US$ 3.70 to 5.50 per acre.  Therefore, a total of seven applications may cost up to US$ 26.00 to US$ 38.50 per acre.

The state of Parana is the second leading soybean producing state in Brazil and although the worm was not a significant problem in Parana last growing season, it has already been found in newly planted soybeans fields in northern Parana and southern Sao Paulo.  Some farmers in Parana have already started spraying and for their application they applied a heavier than normal dose of insecticide in an attempt to keep the pest under control.  In the state of Sao Paulo the insect has been found in wheat, soybeans, corn, and dry beans.

<p>
The third largest soybean producing state is Rio Grande do Sul in far southern Brazil and the insect has not been found as yet in the state.  State agricultural officials have set up a series of traps all across the state in order to monitor if and where the insect appears.
</p>
<p>
In all major crop producing regions of Brazil it appears that volunteer corn, soybeans, cotton and some common weeds have acted as host plants for the insect allowing it to move from crop to crop and from one growing season to another.

Brazilian scientists from Embrapa have established the following website with information on how to identify the caterpillar and how to control it (<a href=http://www.embrapa.br/alerta-helicoverpa>http://www.embrapa.br/alerta-helicoverpa</a>).
