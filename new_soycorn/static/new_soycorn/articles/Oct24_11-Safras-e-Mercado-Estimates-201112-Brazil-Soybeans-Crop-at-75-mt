Safras e Mercado Estimates 2011/12 Brazil Soybean Crop at 75.3 mt
<p>
	The consulting agency <i>Safras e Mercado</i> released their first estimate for the 2011/12 Brazilian soybean crop estimating the new crop at 75.3 million tons.  They feel that the 2011/12 soybean crop could set a new record for Brazil, but that is because they have a lower estimate for the 2010/11 crop compared to Conab and the USDA.  <i>Safras</i> is estimating the 2010/11 Brazilian soybean crop at 74.38 million tons compared to Conab's estimate of 75.3 million tons and the USDA's estimate of 75.5 million tons.

	<i>Safras</i> is projecting that the 2011/12 Brazilian soybean acreage will increase from 24.2 million hectares to 24.8 million hectares or an increase of 3%.  They estimate that the average soybean yield will be 3,034 kg/ha (44.0 bu/ac) compared to 3,077 bu/ac (44.6 bu/ac) obtained in 2010/11.

	According to their calculations, Mato Grosso continues to be the largest soybean producing state with a soybean acreage of 6.7 million hectares or an increase of 5% compared to last year.  The total soybean production in the state is estimated at 21.4 million tons, also a 5% increase compared to last year.

	They estimate the soybean acreage in Parana will be 4.5 million hectares and the total soybean production in the state will be 14.4 million tons, or down 1% and 6% respectively.  The soybean acreage in Rio Grande do Sul is estimated to be unchanged at 4.53 million hectares and the total production in the state is expected to decline 3% to 11.1 million tons.

The largest expansion of soybean acreage is predicted for northern Brazil where the entire region is expected to plant 688,000 hectares, or 9% more than in 2010/11.  The soybean acreage is expected to increase 11% in the state of Para, 10% in Roraima, 9% in Tocantins, and 9% and Rondonia.

	Their senior analysts, Flavio Franca Junior, anticipates that soybean yields will be lower in southern Brazil in 2011/12 compared to 2010/11 because of a mild La Nina that is expected to persist through the end of the year.  Some meteorologists are predicting that La Nina could result in dryer than normal weather in southern Brazil during the months of November and December.
