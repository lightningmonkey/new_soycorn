<h3><h3>Safrinha Corn Harvest Advances Slowly in Mato Grosso</h3></h3>
<p>
	Harvesting of the <i>safrinha</i> corn crop in Mato Grosso is advancing very slowly.  According to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea), after three or four weeks of harvest activity, only 15% of the corn crop has been harvested in the state.  Approximately 250,000 hectares of the 1.7 million planted have been harvested.  Last year at this time 41% of the crop had been harvested.  The north-central part of the state is the most advanced with 20% harvested, followed by the northern regions at 18%, northeast at 14%, western at 12%, and southern regions at 7%.

Imea estimates that the statewide corn yield will decline 10% compared to 2010, but many farmers in the state are expecting yields to fall much more in the range of 20%-30%-40%-50%.  The reasons for the declining yields are late planting and the early onset of the dry season.

The freezing temperatures that have afflicted southern Brazil over the last week have not made it far enough north to impact the corn crop in Mato Grosso.  The cold temperatures have impacted the <i>safrinha</i> corn crop in Mato Grosso do Sul where freezing temperatures were recorded earlier last week.
</p>
<p>
As a result of the cold weather in southern Brazil and the dry weather in central Brazil, the total <i>safrinha</i> corn production in 2011 is expected to be disappointing.
