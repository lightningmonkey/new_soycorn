Farmers in Mato Grosso List Concerns about Soybean Production
<p>
	The Mato Gross Soybean and Corn Producers Association (Aprosoja) recently released the results of a survey they conducted listing the concerns of soybean producers in the state.  During a ten day period between October 15th and October 26th, Aprosoja sent out five teams of technicians that visited 332 farms all across the state.  The farms that were visited plant approximately 750,000 hectares of soybeans or about 10% of the soybean acreage in the state.  The principal production concerns listed by the farmers include the following:
</p>
<p>
	<b>Nematodes</b> - Eighty percent of the farms visited had a significant problem with nematodes in their soybean fields.  These microscopic worms live on the roots of soybeans and are a significant yield threat to the crop.  The best way to control the worms is to rotate crops and plant soybean varieties that are resistant to the types of nematodes found in the area, but the problem is that the nematodes continually develop new races to overcome the resistance.  As a result, it eventually turns into an "arms race" between the soybean breeders and the nematodes.  This is going to be a chronic ongoing problem in Brazil and the best that can be hoped for is for a stand-off keeping the losses from nematodes at a minimum.
</p>
<p>
	When widespread soybean production began in Brazil in the 1960's, nematodes were not a problem.  Over the insuring decades though, soybeans were produced as a monocrop with little thought of rotating to other crop to avoid a buildup of diseases and pests such as nematodes.  U.S. farmers have the same problem with nematodes, but routine crop rotations in the U.S. help to control the pest.

	<b>Leaf eating worms, insects, and diseases</b> - Mato Grosso has a tropical climate and in any hot and humid environment, a multitude of insects can be expected in the fields including soybeans.  The average soybean producer in Mato Grosso applies two applications of insecticides per growing season in order to control the various insects.  Farmers are concerned that recent restrictions by the Brazilian EPA on the type and the timing of insecticide applications may make the problem even worse.  Additionally, farmers are noticing that insects that used to be rare in the state are now becoming a much larger problem.  Soybean rust is a prime example of a disease that was unknown in Brazil until the 2000/01 growing season, but has now become a chronic and widespread problem in Brazil.  
</p>
<p>
	<b>Invasive weed species</b> - When soybean production started in the state, weed control was a minor concern for farmers.  In fact, many farmers used only minimal amounts of herbicides for many years after a field was brought into production because there were very few weeds.  That has now changed and weed control is becoming a bigger concern for farmers in central Brazil especially weeds such as pigweed that has developed resistance to Roundup herbicide.  As long as farmers continue to produce a monocrop of soybeans, their weed problems are going to get worse.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Lack of adequate storage</b> - The lack of storage is becoming a bigger problem especially in the eastern part of the state where many ranchers are converting some of their pastureland to soybean production.  A lack of adequate infrastructure has always been a problem in Brazil, but it becomes even more acute when the rate of production increases far outpaces the infrastructure development.
	</p>
<p>
	<b>Poor seed quality</b> - The teams collected 446 samples of soybean seed that was used to plant this year's crop and they tested the seed for quality.  The minimum standard for soybean seed germination in Brazil is 80%, but 19% of the seed samples collected tested below the minimum standard.  If a farmer knows ahead of time that the germination is going to be sub-standard, he can compensate by planting more seeds per hectare.  The problem in Brazil is that many farmers do not purchase certified seed and when they purchases non-certified seed, they run the risk of not being informed that they have sub-standard seed.
</p>
<p>
	The results of planting sub-standard seed will only be noticed once the crop is planted.  If the soybean stand is inadequate, there is little for the farmer to do expect hope for good weather during the growing season so that the existing plants can partially compensate for the missing plants. 
</p>
<p>
	<b>Poor fertilizer quality</b> - The teams also collected fertilizer samples from the farmers to be tested for purity.  Those samples are still being analyzed, but prior surveys have shown that a significant portion of the fertilizers purchased in Brazil do not have the level of active ingredients that are listed on the label.  In other words, the farmers are paying for something that is not actually in the fertilizer.  Farmers have complained about the quality of the fertilizers in Brazil, but the problem continues to persist.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Summary</b> - All of these factors listed tend to increase the cost of production not only for farmers in Mato Grosso, but for soybean producers all across Brazil.  It also illustrates that the federal government is woefully lacking in their oversight of the inputs used by farmers to insure that they adhere to the minimal standards set by the government.
