<h3><h3>Intacta RR2 Pro Soybeans to be Planted for the First Time in Brazil</h3></h3>
<p>
	The 2013/14 growing season will be the first year that Brazilian farmers will be allowed to plant Intacta RR2 PRO soybeans, which were developed by Monsanto specifically for the Brazilian market.  The company expects to sell 2.8 million sacks of seed (60 kilograms each) which would be enough to plant 2.5 million hectares or about 9% of the expected 2013/14 soybean acreage in Brazil.

	This second generation of GMO soybeans is not only herbicide resistant; they are also resistant to many leaf-eating worms as well.  Brazilian farmers routinely apply several insecticides applications to their soybeans to control these pests and Intacta soybeans are expected to greatly reduce the need for insecticide use in addition to boosting soybean yields.

	Intacta soybean varieties, which employ the Bt gene widely used in insect resistant corn, will not be able to gain the 90% market share enjoyed by Roundup Ready soybeans because the new soybeans must be accompanied by a 20% refuse where the technology is not used.  The refuse is required to help prevent the worms from mutating and eventually overcoming the technology.

	The latest pest to invade the soybean fields of Brazil is the corn ear worm, which was found for the first time in the soybean, corn, and cotton fields of western Bahia last growing season.  The leaf-eating worm caused significant damage to the crops in the region and has since been found in most of the soybean growing regions of central Brazil.  Monsanto officials feel the new technology will result in a 95% control of the new pest.

	In the future, the company feels this technology may eventually be used to control nematodes as well.  These microscopic worms feed on the roots of soybeans and are a major yield drag.  The only way to control nematodes at this point is with crop rotations and by planting soybean varieties resistant to specific types of nematodes.
