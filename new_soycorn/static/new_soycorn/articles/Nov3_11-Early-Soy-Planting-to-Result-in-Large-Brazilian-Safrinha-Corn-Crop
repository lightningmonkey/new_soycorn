<h3><h3>Early Soy Planting to Result in Large Brazilian Safrinha Corn Crop</h3></h3>
<p>
	With the rapid planting of the 2011/12 soybean crop in Mato Grosso, it is nearly guaranteed that the farmers in the state will have time to plant their second crop of corn or cotton during the appropriate planting window.  The only thing that could delay the planting of the <i>safrinha</i> corn or cotton would be heavy rains that delay the soybean harvest.  
</p>
<p>
The north central region of Mato Grosso has the highest percentage of <i>safrinha</i> corn and in that region soybean planting is already 70-80% complete with some farmers having already finished planting their soybeans in record time.  Many farmers in the region plant early maturing soybeans (95 day maturity) or medium maturity soybeans (110 day maturity).  If the early maturing soybeans were planted during the second half of September, it is possible that some might be ready for harvest by the end of December.  Certainly the early maturing soybeans will be ready for harvest during January and the medium maturing soybeans will be ready to harvest by early February.

<p>
The optimum planting window for <i>safrinha</i> corn in Mato Grosso ends about the third week of February and for <i>safrinha</i> cotton, the optimum window ends about the end of January.

	Due to the early soybean planting, there are now reports that some farmers intend to double crop every hectare of soybeans with a second crop of corn if they can find enough corn seed.  Nearly 50% of the intended <i>safrinha</i> corn production in the state has already been forward contracted at very good prices, so the farmers have the needed resources to heavily invest in the second crop of corn.  According to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea), the <i>safrinha</i> corn acreage in the state is expected to increase approximately 15% and surpass 2.0 million hectares.

<i>Safrinha</i> corn yields in Mato Grosso are expected to be much better in 2011/12 than they were last year.  The 2010/11 crop was planted about a month past the optimum planting window due to a delayed start to the soybean planting and heavy rains that delayed the soybean harvest.  To make matters even worse, the rainy season ended about a month earlier than normal which severely impacted the yields of the latest planted corn.

<p>
The farmers in the state are expecting a much better outcome for their 2011/12 <i>safrinha</i> corn crop.
