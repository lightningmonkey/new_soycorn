<h3><h3>Mato Grosso Farmers to Increase Soy and Corn Acreage in 2012/13</h3></h3>
<p>
	Brazilian soybean farmers are expected to expand their 2012/13 soybean acreage by 2 million hectares in 2012/13 to 27 million for a new record high acreage.  Approximately 800,000 of those new hectares will be in the state of Mato Grosso, which is Brazil's largest producer.  In their latest estimate, the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) estimates that farmers in the state will increase their soybean acreage by 11.6% from 7.07 million hectares to 7.89 million hectares (19.5 million acres).  If achieved, the soybean acreage in Mato Grosso would be approximately the same as the 2012 soybean acreage in Iowa, Illinois, and Wisconsin combined.

	Most of the increased acreage will be from the conversion of pastureland to row crop production in the eastern and northern parts of the state.  The primary agricultural activity in eastern and northern Mato Grosso is cattle ranching, but in recent years many ranchers have been plowing up their pastures to plant a first crop of soybeans followed by a second crop of corn.  It's an easy economic decision to make since soybean and corn prices are at record levels and cattle prices have been depressed.

Imea estimates that the statewide average soybean yield in 2012/13 will be 51 sacks per hectare (3,060 kg/ha or 44.3 bu/ac) and the total production will be 24.1 million tons or 2 million more than in 2011/12.  The average soybean yield in the state has remained relatively constant in recent years due to all the new acres being brought into production.  Many of the new areas have lower yields due to the relatively low fertility found in the pastures.  After several years of proper fertilization, the soybean yields tend to increase.

	Imea also released a new estimate for the newly harvested <i>safrinha</i> corn crop in Mato Grosso.  They are now estimating that 15.5 million tons of corn was produced in the state in 2011/12 or an increase of 123% compared to last season.  Farmers planted an increased acreage of <i>safrinha</i> corn in 2011/12 (2.5 million hectares), but the big difference has been the corn yields.  The average corn yield in the state set a new record at 104 sacks per hectare or 6,232 kg/ha (96 bu/ac).  Ideal weather and an extended rainy season were the main reasons for the high yields.
</p>
<p>
	For the 2012/13 growing season, Imea estimates that farmers will increase their <i>safrinha</i>i corn acreage to 2.9 million hectares, but the corn yields will not be as high as this year.  They are expecting yields to be 80 sacks per hectare (4,800 kg/ha or 74 bu/ac) with a total production of 13.8 million tons or approximately 11% less than in 2011/12.

	In Conab's latest assessment of the 2011/12 growing season, they estimated that the state of Mato Grosso produced 25% of Brazil's total grain production.
