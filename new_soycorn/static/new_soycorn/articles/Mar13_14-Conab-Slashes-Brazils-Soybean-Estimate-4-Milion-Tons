Conab Slashes Brazil's Soybean Estimate 4.57 Million Tons (-5%)
<p>
	In their sixth evaluation of the 2013/14 growing season Conab reduced the Brazilian soybean estimate 4.5 million tons from 90.03 million to the current estimate of 85.44 million or a reduction of 4.57 million tons (-5%).  The stated reason for the decline was adverse weather in eastern and southern Brazil during the critical pod filling period.

<p>
	The biggest declines in soybean production were registered in the states of Parana, Minas Gerais, and Goias.  The state with the largest overall decline was Parana which dropped more than 2 million tons in one month from 16.73 to 14.68 million tons (-12.2%).  The northern part of the state encountered extremely high temperatures in January and more than 30 days without rainfall resulting in soybean yield losses of 40% or more in the region.

The southeastern state of Minas Gerais registered a decline of 13.9% in its soybean crop from 3.77 to 3.30 million tons.  The problem in the state was also the hot and dry conditions registered during January and early February.  A similar situation occurred in the state of Goias where the soybean estimate declined 8.6% from February to March (9.46 to 8.64 million tons).

<p>
Nationwide, the Brazilian soybean yield is now estimated at 2,867 kg/ha (41.5 bu/ac), which is a decline of 2.4% compared to the 2,938 kg/ha (42.6 bu/ac) achieved in 2012/13.  The soybean acreage was increased slightly from the previous month (+134,000 hectares) to 29.8 million hectares or 7.4% more than the previous growing season.

The 2013/14 Brazilian corn estimate was trimmed slightly from last month's estimate of 75.46 million to the current estimate of 75.18 million tons.  The full-season corn estimate was trimmed slightly month-to-month and the <i>safrinha</i> corn estimate was increased slightly from the prior month.  Conab now estimates that the full-season corn crop will be 31.42 million tons (41.8% of the total) and the <i>safrinha</i> corn crop will be 43.75 million tons (58.2% of the total).
</p>
<p>
The full-season corn acreage is down 5.1% compared to last year and the <i>safrinha</i> corn acreage is down 3.9% compared to the last growing season.  The full-season corn lost acreage in southern Brazil as farmers switched to more soybeans.  The <i>safrinha</i> corn acreage declined due to farmers planting more cotton and soybeans as a second crop in Mato Grosso and more winter wheat as the second crop in Parana.
