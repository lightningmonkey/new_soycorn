2014/15 Soybean Planting off to a Fast Start in Brazil
<p>
	The weather has generally been favorable for early soybean planting in Brazil.  As of September 26th, the state most advanced in soybean planting in Brazil is Parana in southern Brazil where 7% of the soybeans have been planted.  Last year only 2% of the soybeans in the state were planted by September 26th.  In small regions of the state near the cities of Cascavel and Toledo 30-35% of the soybeans have already been planted.  Parana is the second leading soybean producing state in Brazil.

	The soybeans already planted in Parana will be ready to be harvested starting at Christmas time.  Farmers in Parana are expected to plant 5.05 million hectares of soybeans or 3% more than in 2013/14.

	Mato Grosso is the leading soybean producing state and approximately 2% of the crop has been planted in the state since farmers were allowed to start planting on September 15th.  Last year at this time 1% of the crop had been planted in the state.  Even the Brazilian Minister of Agriculture Neri Geller, who is from Mato Grosso, commented recently that he cannot remember in his 30 years of farming such good early moisture for soybean planting in the state.

	Farmers in Mato Grosso are expected to plant 8.8 million hectares of soybeans and if the weather is good during the growing season, the state of Mato Grosso could produce 28 million tons of soybeans or about 30% of the total Brazilian soybean crop estimated at 95 million tons.  If Brazil achieves that level of production, it would be slightly less than 10 million tons more than the 2013/14 Brazilian soybean crop.
