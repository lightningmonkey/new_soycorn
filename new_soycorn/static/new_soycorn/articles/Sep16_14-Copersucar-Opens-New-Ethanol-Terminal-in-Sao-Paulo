Copersucar Opens New Ethanol Terminal in Sao Paulo
<p>
	Copersucar inaugurated its new ethanol terminal in Paulinia, Sao Paulo last week.  The <i>Terminal Copersucar de Ethanol (TCE)</i> has a total capacity of 180 million liters encompassing ten storage tanks varying in size from 5 to 40 million liters.  The total volume of ethanol that is expected to move through the facility during this first phase is estimated at 2.3 billion liters per harvest season.  As a comparison, this terminal will have the capacity to handle approximately half of all the ethanol sold by Copersucar which was 4.9 billion liters in 2013/14.

The R$ 150 million facility is capable of receiving ethanol by truck or by pipeline and it includes parking for 100 tanker trucks.  Eventually, Copersucar expects that much of the ethanol will arrive at the terminal via a pipeline thus reducing the need for truck transport and avoiding the inherit risks of having thousands of loads of ethanol traversing Brazil's highways.
