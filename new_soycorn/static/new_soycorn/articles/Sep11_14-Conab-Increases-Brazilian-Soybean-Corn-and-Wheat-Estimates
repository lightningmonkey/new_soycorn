<p>
	In their September Crop Report, which is their twelfth assessment of the 2013/14 growing season in Brazil, Conab increased their estimates for both soybean and corn production.  The Brazilian soybean estimate was increased 0.46 million tons from the August estimate to 86.12 million.  The soybean crop is now estimated at 5.7% larger than the 81.5 million tons produced in 2012/13.

	The soybean acreage in Brazil was increased 38,000 hectares from the August estimate to 30.173 million hectares or 8.8% more than the 27.73 million hectares planted in 2012/13.  The nationwide soybean yield was increased slightly in September from 2,842 kg/ha (41.2 bu/ac) in August to 2,854 kg/ha (41.3 bu/ac) in September.  Hot and dry weather during December and January in Sao Paulo and Parana significantly reduced the soybean production in those two states.  As a result, the nationwide soybean yield in 2013/14 is 2.9% lower than the 2,938 kg/ha (42.6 bu/ac) produced in 2012/13.

	Conab made a significant change this month in the Brazilian corn production.  The Brazilian corn estimate was increased 1.35 million tons to 79.9 million.  The 2013/14 corn crop is now only 2% smaller than the 81.5 million tons produced in 2012/13.   The big change occurred in the safrinha corn production where the acreage was increased 55,000 hectares from last month to 9.182 million hectares.  The safrinha corn yield was also increased from 5,136 kg/ha (79.1 bu/ac) to 5,255 kg/ha (80.9 bu/ac).  As a result, the safrinha corn crop is now estimated at 48.25 million tons or 60.4% of Brazil's total corn crop.

	The Brazilian wheat production was also significantly increased.  The 2013/14 Brazilian wheat crop is now estimated at 7.66 million tons or 38.7% more than the 5.52 million tons produced in 2012/13.  The state of Parana is expected to produce 3.97 million tons of wheat followed by Rio Grande do Sul at 3.09 million tons.  These two states combined are expected to produce 92% of Brazil's 2013/14 total wheat crop.
