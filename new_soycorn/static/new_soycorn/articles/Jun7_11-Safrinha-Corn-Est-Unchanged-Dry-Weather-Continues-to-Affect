Safrinha Corn Est. Unchanged, Dry Weather Continues to Affect
<p>
	The last remaining crop in South America that could still be impacted by the weather is the <i>safrinha</i> corn crop in Brazil.  The dry season started a month earlier than anticipated in Mato Grosso and as a result, a significant portion of the corn crop is encountering moisture stress as the crop fills grain.  Parana is the second leading producer of <i>safrinha</i> corn and the state has been basically dry for the last month.  At this writing, there is some rain in the near-term forecast for Parana and maybe southern Mato Grosso and if the forecast verifies, it would help the late planted <i>safrinha</i> corn especially in Parana.

The Brazilian corn estimate was left unchanged at 52 million tons which is 3 or 4 million tons below the estimates of the USDA and Conab respectively.  The <i>safrinha</i> corn harvest will begin in Mato Grosso at the end of June and continue through July.  The <i>safrinha</i> corn harvest in Parana will occur during July and August.
